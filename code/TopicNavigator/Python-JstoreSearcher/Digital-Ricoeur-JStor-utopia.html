  Abstract: The word “utopia” was coined by Thomas More, who invented it to describe an ideal society in his
                  De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia(On the best state of a commonwealth and on the new island of utopia) (1516), the first book in the long series of utopian literature that More’s famous work initiated. The complex meaning of the wordutopiaoriginates from the nomenclature and from the literature with which it has become associated. Composed of the Greekou(written as Latinuby More), which describes a negative quality, and the wordtopos, which means place<br>

  Book Title: Imaginary Communities-Utopia, the Nation, and the Spatial Histories of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wegner Phillip E.<br>
  Abstract: Drawing from literary history, social theory, and political critique, this far-reaching study explores the utopian narrative as a medium for understanding the social space of the modern nation-state. Considering the narrative utopia from its earliest manifestation in Thomas More's sixteenth-century work
      Utopiato some of the most influential utopias of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this book is an astute study of a literary genre as well as a nuanced dialectical meditation on the history of utopian thinking as a quintessential history of modernity. As he unravels the dialectics at work in the utopian narrative, Wegner gives an ambitious synthetic discussion of theories of modernity, considering and evaluating the ideas of writers such as Ernst Bloch, Louis Marin, Gilles Deleuze, Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Henri Lefebvre, Paul de Man, Karl Mannheim, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jürgen Habermas, Slavoj Zizek, and Homi Bhabha.<br>

  Abstract: Fredric Jameson’s assertion that utopia’s deepest subject is its own inconceivability—its own failure of imagination, in a sense—baldly contravenes a positivist utopian tradition characterized precisely as the full-fledged blueprint of an alternative, more perfect society. Jameson’s negative utopianism embraces this aspect of failure, but it is important to understand that this failure is not simply the commonplace fatality of a compromised individual or authorial imagination. It is, instead, what Jameson calls “the systemic, cultural, and ideological closure of which we are all in one way or another prisoners.”¹ Despite Thomas More’s inspiration for, and association with, utopianism of<br>

  Book Title: Hope and the Longing for Utopia-Futures and Illusions in Theology and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

  Abstract: In her book

  Abstract: A utopian tale traditionally begins by recounting how a traveller discovered utopia, usually by stumbling across it accidentally. I stumbled across “utopia” as a subject by editing two Frye texts, first the “Third Book” notebooks, and later the Collected Works edition of

Somewhere around 1964, Northrop Frye began recording notes toward what he called the “Third Book”—that is, his third major work afterFearful SymmetryandAnatomy of Criticism. SinceAnatomywas a “centripetal” approach, concerned with the formal relations of literature, the Third Book was to be about criticism and society. Its first subject was<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of ~<br>

  FRAMING FAMOUS LIVES IN AUSTRALIA from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr5j8">Migrant Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Fox Karen<br>
  Abstract: The genres of autobiographical writing and utopian writing have little in common. While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

  Abstract: The links between colonization and the Republic remain of utmost importance and relevance to contemporary debates in French society. Might colonization, in fact, represent the inevitable reverse side of what stands as a universal utopia, one that invariably becomes less and less “pure” as one moves away from the center (the metropole), and as the color of the people who are theoretically placed under its “protection” becomes darker? Such complex questions are no doubt impossible to answer definitively. However, they do have the merit of clearly setting out an issue that has, until now, often been avoided or, at times,<br>

  Abstract: In this early dawn of the twenty-first century, following one of humanity’s darkest seasons, revolution is seen as offering little promise and posing little threat. But only yesteryear, during the discontinuous yet not unrelated epochs of the French and Russian revolutions, promise and threat were vigorous and inextricably entwined. Indeed, revolution presents two contrasting faces: the one glorious and appealing; the other violent and terrifying.¹ Today utopia is completely eclipsed by dystopia. In much of the First and Second World there is a consensus, articulated by Hannah Arendt, that “freedom has been better preserved in countries where no revolution ever<br>

  Author(s) Bahloul Joëlle<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  Abstract: Anger, hope, Utopia, and radicalism are the four axes of V. Y. Mudimbe’s work in the 1970s. There is in this corpus a marked tendency to exaggerate the West’s supposed oneness and to convey the impression that the world, to use an expression first coined by Chinweizu² and the American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins,³ is made up of the ‘West and the Rest’. This dualistic dimension is all the more surprising given that Mudimbe advocates at the end of both

  Abstract: Saint Thomas More's
      Utopiais one of the most important works of European humanism and serves as a key text in survey courses on Western intellectual history, the Renaissance, political theory, and many other subjects. Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this masterful translation. In a new afterword to this edition, Jerry Harp contextualizes More's life andUtopiawithin the wider frames of European humanism and the Renaissance."Clarence H. Miller's fine translation tracks the supple variations of More's Latin with unmatched precision, and his Introduction and notes are masterly. Jerry Harp's new Afterword adroitly places More's wonderful little book into its broader contexts in intellectual history."-George M. Logan, author ofThe Meaning of More's "Utopia""Sir Thomas More'sUtopiais not merely one of the foundational texts of western culture, but also a book whose most fundamental concerns are as urgent now as they were in 1516 when it was written. Clarence H. Miller's wonderful translation of More's classic is now happily once again available to readers. This is the English edition that best captures the tone and texture of More's original Latin, and its notes and introduction, along with the lively afterward by Jerry Harp, graciously supply exactly the kinds of help a modern reader might desire."-David Scott Kastan, Yale University<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  The Utopian Impulse after 1968: RUSSIAN ΜΕΤΑ-UTOPIAN FICTION IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT from:

  Abstract: Meta-utopian fiction written since 1987 is, as might be expected, more radically reductive than its forebears, finding naked coercion behind all but the most locally defined ideologies. It exposes a similar matrix of responses as the critical discussion about utopia. On the one hand, it harbors the same fear of the abyss as the only real alternative to stable, if oppressive, order, while, on the other, it is strongly concerned with reopening language to untried possibility, with reexamining deep social scripts, and with probing automatized readerly expectations.

  Abstract: Robert Nozick's
                  Anarchy, State, and Utopia(1974), along with John Rawls’sA Theroy of Justice(1971), radically changed the landscape in analytic political philosophy. For much of the preceding half-century, under the influence of logical heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with metaethics (e.g. the semantics of moral discourse), with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the centre of attention. This all changed with the publication of Rawls’s articulation and defence of liberal egalitarianism and Nozick’s libertarian challenge to the legitimacy of<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 18, ‘Here and Nowhere: Poststructuralism, Resistance and Utopia’, Sotiropoulos explores the thorny problem of a poststructuralist politics or, more particularly, a poststructuralist politics of resistance. By way of an illuminating and engaging cross-comparative analysis of Foucault, Deleuze and Derrida, Sotiropoulos argues that poststructuralism can itself be seen as an event of political resistance, that it works with and through various conceptions of utopia, mobilised as so many potential material movements immanent to becomings that are at play in the social and political world. However, this poststructuralist politics of resistance is not without limits, according to Sotiropoulos, as it<br>

Evanescence is found in the ‘in-between’. The evanescent moment is defined as the event of ‘the philosophical realisation of the art of politics’ (Rancière 1995: 19). As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

In my attempt to recapture those moments of communitas, of spectacular yet subtle beauty and grace in the performances I chronicle here, I’ve been challenged to write in a way that in itself mirrors the alchemical combustions of those utopian performatives.

  Author(s): INGRAM JAMES D.<br>
  Abstract: Utopia has long been banished from political theory, framed as an impossible-and possibly dangerous-political ideal, a flawed social blueprint, or a thought experiment without any practical import. Even the "realistic utopias" of liberal theory strike many as wishful thinking. Can politics think utopia otherwise? Can utopian thinking contribute to the renewal of politics?In
      Political Uses of Utopia, an international cast of leading and emerging theorists agree that the uses of utopia for politics are multiple and nuanced and lie somewhere between-or, better yet, beyond-the mainstream caution against it and the conviction that another, better world ought to be possible. Representing a range of perspectives on the grand tradition of Western utopianism, which extends back half a millennium and perhaps as far as Plato, these essays are united in their interest in the relevance of utopianism to specific historical and contemporary political contexts. Featuring contributions from Miguel Abensour, Étienne Balibar, Raymond Geuss, and Jacques Rancière, among others,Political Uses of Utopiareopens the question of whether and how utopianism can inform political thinking and action today.<br>

  Author(s) CHROSTOWSKA S. D.<br>
  Abstract: Our problematic in this volume on the “uses of utopia for politics” brings together what commonly comes in separate packages. To be sure, mainstream readings of modern Western political history support the attribution of a utopian dimension to left–radical politics, and, conversely, of radical, if covert, political motives to utopia. The historic conflation of utopianism and political radicalism does not, however, explain the internal crisis of the Left any more than it explains today’s generalized political apathy. Neither does it absolve this apathy’s dispirited sufferers of their tendency to equate legitimate politics with a crude, calculating realism, one that<br>

  Book Title: The World as Metaphor in Robert Musil's 'The Man without Qualities'-Possibility as Reality<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Grill Genese<br>
  Abstract: Robert Musil, known to be a scientific and philosophical thinker, was committed to aesthetics as a process of experimental creation of an ever-shifting reality. Musil wanted, above all, to be a creative writer, and obsessively engaged in almost endless deferral via variations and metaphoric possibilities in his novel project, 'The Man without Qualities.' This lifelong process of writing is embodied in the unfinished novel by a recurring metaphor of self-generating de-centered circle worlds. The present study analyzes this structure with reference to Musil's concepts of the utopia of the Other Condition, Living and Dead Words, Specific and Non-Specific Emotions, Word Magic, and the Still Life. In contrast to most recent studies of Musil, it concludes that the extratemporal metaphoric experience of the Other Condition does not fail, but rather constitutes the formal and ethical core of Musil's novel. The first study to utilize the newly published Klagenfurt Edition of Musil's literary remains (a searchable annotated text), 'The World as Metaphor' offers a close reading of variations and text genesis, shedding light not only on Musil's novel, but also on larger questions about the modernist artist's role and responsibility in consciously re-creating the world. Genese Grill holds a PhD in Germanic Literatures and Languages from the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York.<br>

If utopia, oύ (“not”) and τόπoς (“place”), is a “no place,” a place that does not exist except as a vision of a better world, Auschwitz was a “no place” where a world ended, a place where existence was negated.

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Book Title: Utopian Horizons-Ideology, Politics, Literature<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Czigányik Zsolt<br>
  Abstract: The 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s Utopia has directed attention toward the importance of utopianism. Utopian Horizons investigates the possibilities of cooperation between the humanities and the social sciences in the analysis of 20th century and contemporary utopian phenomena. The papers deal with major problems of interpreting utopias, the relationship of utopia and ideology, and the highly problematic issue as to whether utopia necessarily leads to dystopia. Besides reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary utopian investigations, the papers effectively represent the constructive attitudes of utopian thought, a feature that not only defines late 20th- and 21st-century utopianism, but is one of the primary reasons behind the rising importance of the topic.<br>

  Abstract: In the chapter I wrote for the

This fluctuation of meaning, I then tried to show, was largely due to the never-ending tension that prevails between the concept ofutopia(literally a “nonplace”) and<br>

  Abstract: The next step in this discussion ought to be the interaction between the writing of literature and the writing of history, and, almost inevitably, the contrastive role played by utopia.

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: To anticipate a criticism of the use of Habermas’s discourse ethics, there should be acknowledgment of Bent Flyvbjerg’s opinion, which is shared by a number of people: “The basic weakness of Habermas’s project is its lack of agreement between ideal and reality, between intentions and their implementation” [
      36, p. 215]. In directly countering Habermas’s discourse ethics, Foucault says, “The problem, then, is not to try to dissolve [power relations] in the utopia of completely transparent communication but to acquire the rules of law, the management techniques, and also the morality, the ethos, the practice of the self, that will allow us to play these games of power with as little domination as possible” [37, p. 298]. However, Habermas does admit, “Bargaining processes are tailored for situations in which social power relations cannot be neutralized in the way rational discourses presuppose” [38, p. 166]. Their positions are not so far apart, and the common ground is the ethics of the discursive practice. Furthermore, Habermas and Foucault share some phenomenological justification for their positions. Communication may not be transparent, as the Habermasian ideal would prefer, but neither is power a totally corrupting force. There are times when the discourse in librarianship will be agonistic (competitive and possibly strained); an agreed‐upon set of rules for ethical communication is still the most effective antidote to disruption and authoritarianism and assurance of rights being recognized.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522064<br>
Date: 03 2007<br>
Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If a particular conception of the future proves no longer capable of exercising its pull on the present, the spell cast by the phrases “our modernity,” and “history itself” is finally broken and the present is released from playing the role of shaping experience according to expectations promising the achievement of progressive perfectibility. I am not suggesting, as contemporary endists do, that the temporality of the future, as such, has been evicted from our historical horizon or has been realized, thus putting an end to history. While there have been appeals to a triumphal end of history after the cold war and dire predictions of a present that now portends ecological disaster, not to mention the fraudulent promise to end the threat of terrorism itself, presentism is not the same as the simple present any more than an indeterminate and unknowable future is synonymous with futurism. Yet too often these temporal dimensions have been misrecognized, out of ambition, desire, and menace, in an effort to invest with meaning, purpose, and even direction the outcomes of the present and future. The most familiar marker of the experience upheld by presentism and futurism has invariably pointed to either an achieved or completed modernity (as well as its “alternative”) or the aspiration of a utopia yet to come. In some instances, abrupt changes opened upon a future filled with either possibility or peril and destruction. Too often such demands, whatever the political motivation, have aimed at overcoming a present both dominated by the processes of capitalism, as Marx demonstrated, and by its “rhythms” and “symmetries,” as described by Georg Simmel. With fascism, it is well to recall, there was an inordinate promise to save capitalism from itself and from liberalism, whereas communism sought to rid capitalism entirely from historical society.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 518276<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Abstract: This doubled character of a promise satisfies Tillich’s description of prophetic critique. It cannot be fixed yet must appear present.
         42If the prophetic were to appear forever cemented in finitude, it would fail to be prophetic, and it would cease to be the transcendent. Likewise, Tillich claims that any “form of grace,” any immanent appearance of prophetic critique, will always anticipate a future.43It will always rightly hold open the hope of a future, a utopia perhaps, or the fulfilled reign of God.<br>

Abstract: The political vicissitudes endured by Leopoldo Lugones through both his attitudes and writings are described in this paper. On the one hand, his initial political Utopia reflected in the American post-romanticism, with a leader as Ruben Dario, progressive for the period. As of 1910, the political situation of an Argentina with masses largely integrated by foreingners, and with the social burdens they carry have turned him towards a feeling of the reality of his country, which is dominated by English imperialism. In 1938, faced with the impossibility of changing this reality, Lugones commits suicide. /// Las vicisitudes políticas sufridas por Leopoldo Lugones a través de sus actitudes y escritos se describen en este trabajo. En primer lugar su inicial utopía política reflejada en el post romanticismo americano, con un líder como Rubén Dario, progresista para la época. A partir de 1910, la situación política de una Argentina cuyas masas se integran con extranjeros en gran parte, y con las cargas sociales que ellas traen, lo vuelcan hacia un sentimiento de la realidad de su país, que se halla dominado por el imperialismo inglés. En 1838, ante la imposibilidad de modificar esa realidad, Lugones se suicida.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the interplay of religion and Utopia in Fredric Jameson's recent Archaeologies of the Future, I identify a tension: on the one hand, the content of religion has been superseded (although not its forms), yet, on the other, Jameson still wishes to make use of a hermeneutics of suspicion and recovery in which even the most retrograde material may be recuperated—religion included. So we find a clash underway in this work. Sometimes Jameson sidelines religion, as one would expect if religion was no longer relevant. At other times, he exercises his dialectical hermeneutics, particularly at two moments: first, a recovery, via Feuerbach, of the role of magic within fantasy literature; second, the partial treatment of apocalyptic, which comes very close to his own argument for Utopia as rupture. From here, I develop the dialectic of ideology and Utopia further by expanding Jameson's comments on the possibilities of medieval theology and the utopian role of religion (both Catholic and Protestant) in More's Utopia.<br>

Abstract: Di parere contrario è Cervigni che nel suo studio mette in evidenza non solo la
mescidanza di stile sublimis e humilis (137-63) ma anche azioni eroiche e volgari
dell'eroe (94-136) e soprattutto l'incapacità dell'autore di configurare una soddisfacente
giustifiazione della sua vita nella parte conclusiva dell'autobiografia che, come è noto,
resta interrotta (165-74). In ogni caso, quando si parla di Cellini, occorre tener presente
non un discorso unilaterale ma dialettico. La mia interpretazione non si limita a
riscontrare la dimensione eroica e tragica nella Vita del Cellini, ma riconosce anche al
suo intemo il disincanto tipico dell'eroe rinascimentale, qui d'accordo con Cervigni.
Questa visione dialettica del pensiero del Rinascimento è stata sostenuta recentemente da
Michele Ciliberto secondo il quale il nucleo centrale dell'esperienza dell'uomo del
Rinascimento consiste precisamente nella "dialettica costante — e mai risolta — tra
disincanto e utopia, tra sogno e disperazione, tra acuto e tragico realismo e una
straordinaria capacità di proiettarsi oltre la realtà, attraverso la costruzione di grandi miti
religiosi, estetici, scientifici e umani [...]" (2).<br>

Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Abstract: Nous avons tenté de montrer que les recherches longtemps réunies sous le nom de biologie de l'art ont constitué les racines oubliées de la pensée anthropologique d'Aby Warburg. Connues par lui en 1895-1896, ces perspectives nourrissent encore en 1927, à la fin de sa vie, sa réflexion. À partir de l'analyse ethnographique de la représentation des noms propres dans le Sepik, nous avons ensuite montré que, pour tenter de déchiffrer l'utopie dont témoigne sa pensée - formuler une anthropologie de la mémoire sociale telle qu'elle se fonde sur les traditions iconographiques -, il est nécessaire de reprendre, d'un point de vue critique, la méthode morphologique de la biologie de l'art, et sa manière de reconstruire les opérations mentales impliquées par le déchiffrement des images. /// The studies that have, for a long time now, been assembled under the name " Biology of Art " form the forgotten roots of Aby Warburg's approach to anthropology. He learned about them in 1895-1896, and the thus opened perspectives were still enriching his thinking at the end of his life in 1927. An analysis of conceptions about proper names in the Sepik area is used to show that, to decipher the utopia in Warburg's thinking - formulate an anthropology of social memory in relation to iconographic traditions - it is necessary to critically examine the morphological method of the biology of art and its way of reconstructing the mental operations involved in deciphering images.<br>

Abstract: Insufficiently radical environmentalism is inadequate to the problems that confront us; but overly radical environmentalism risks alienating people with whom, in a democracy, we must find common cause. Building on Paul Ricoeur's work, which shows how group identity is constituted by the tension between ideology and utopia, this essay asks just how radical effective environmentalism should be. Two "case studies" of environmental agenda—that of Michael Schellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, and that of David Brower—serve to frame the important issues of cooperation and confrontation. The essay concludes that environmentalism must lead with its utopian aspirations rather than its willingness to compromise.<br>

Abstract: Much the same is true of those 'Utopian realists' who, I suggested earlier, in this respect
at least make common cause with Dunn. Giddens, for example, insists that we must
'balance Utopian ideals with realism' given the extremely high-consequence risks of
contemporary social life, echoing Dunn's insistence on the complexity and risk inherent in
modernity, and Booth stresses that his utopianism is not an end-point Utopia but a process
Utopia, agreeing with Dunn's concern that the third task of political theory is to conceive
of realistic ways of getting from where we are to where we might, and should, aim to be.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse à la façon dont certains quartiers relevant de ce que l'École de Chicago avait qualifié de zone de transition peuvent perpétuer des « traditions utopiques » malgré les transformations radicales de l'environnement urbain. On distingue ici trois périodes dans l'histoire urbaine du 13e arrondissement de Paris, successivement caractérisées par trois formes d'utopie: ouvrière, communautaire, puis pluriculturelle; on y repère les échanges et convergences entre l'action confessionnelle engagée et la recherche en sciences sociales. La dernière période voit la conduite de projets pluriculturels pionniers en France, incluant des rituels urbains à visibilité ethnique rendus possibles par cette « tradition utopique » portée par une paroisse locale et sa vie associative. This paper deals with the way urban areas qualified as transitional by the Chicago School of Sociology can generate certain « utopian traditions » which are carried on despite the radical transformations undergone by the environment. Three successive periods of the urban history of the 13th district in Paris, are characterized by three forms of utopia respectively: the first one associated with working class life, the second inspired by communitarian ideologies, and the third emerging from the multicultural environment. Convergences between the parish community social activism and research in social sciences are pointed out all along. In the last period, pioneering multicultural initiatives were supported by these local utopic traditions, introducing in France urban rituals with ethnic visibility.<br>

Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Maldonado-Torres Nelson<br>
Abstract: This article aims to "unthink" influential philosophical articulations of the crisis of Europe in order to articulate a non-Eurocentric epistemological position that aims to give a consistent expression to the interrelational approach of wprld-systems analysis. This alternative epistemology demands and foments a postimperial Utopia and requires no less than the death of ideals that defend the epistemological superiority of European Man. An analysis and critique of works by Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo lead to the formulation of a positive conception of the crisis of Europe and to weak versions of Utopia and "colonial difference." The alternative articulation of these concepts aims to make more flexible and productive the links between knowledge and location. In this way, this article intends to bridge the gap between Wallerstein's world-systems approach and Mignolo's concern with the limits of Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R.

Article Title: Utopia and history. Some remarks about Nikolai Berdjaev's struggle with history<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40027959<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Augustyn Leszek<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the philosophy of Nikolai Berdjaev (1874-1948), which he formulated between The Philosophy of Inequality (written in 1918, but published in 1923) and The New Middle-Ages (1924). Berdjaev's philosophy is analyzed in the context of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and its aftermath. The other point of reference is the crisis of culture and civilisation, which affected the West in the inter-war period. Berdjaev's position has been interpreted in view of the archetypal myth of the struggle of the two principles, the principle of order (cosmos) and the forces of destruction (chaos). This myth is tied to the millenialist world view. Berdjaev took an anti-utopian stance. He juxtaposed the utopianrevolutionary principle with the hierarchical-creative one. From this position he criticized among others democracy, liberalism and socialism. In the midst of the crisis of the 1920s he remarked the possibility of spiritual rejuvenation putting forward the concept of the New Middle-Ages. One can say that at that time Berdjaev's philosophy evolved within the conservative-creative framework, from the utopia of conservatism to the utopia of 'free creativity'.<br>

Author(s): Metzger Jean-Luc<br>
Abstract: Cet article propose d'utiliser le concept d'utopie rationnelle pour rendre compte des pratiques managérìales et tout particulièrement de la production de réformes répétées dans les organisations. Dans cette perspective, après avoir décrit une décennie de transformations au sein d'une organisation publique, certaines caractéristiques de la « culture manageriale » sont dégagées de sa pratique réformatrice. Dans un second temps, le concept d'utopie rationnelle est construit à partir de textes canoniques et des travaux d' « utopologues ». Dans un troisième temps, utopie rationnelle et culture manageriale sont comparées, afin de préciser l'apport cognitif de cet outil à la compréhension du fonctionnement des organisations. This article proposes to use the concept of utopia to account for the managerial practices and especially to explain the production of repeated organizational transformations. From this point of view, the case of a decade of ceaseless transformations into a public organization is first described. Some of the features of the « managerial culture » are then inferred from this empirical statement. In the second place, the concept of rational utopia is constructed, from canonical texts and works of « utopologists ». Finally, rational Utopia and managerial culture are compared, in order to specify the main cognitive contributions of this tool to the understanding of organizational functioning.<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite du rapport de l'engagement et de la connaissance sociologique, en prenant pour terrain la problématique des rapports sociaux de sexe et le féminisme. Plus exactement, c'est la question de l'utopie et de sa fonction heuristique et cognitive éventuelle pour la recherche qui fait l'objet de l'étude. Après avoir rappelé et présenté certains des travaux les plus importants sur la question, il est procédé à une tentative d'élucidation des vertus cognitives de l'utopie féministe matérialiste pour les recherches sur le genre, la différence des sexes et la domination masculine. La conclusion revient sur les implications épistémologiques et méthodologiques de cette étude. This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between engagement and soaological knowledge, in the field of research relevant to gender and feminism. More exactly, the question concerns the heuristic and cognitive functions of utopia. Firstly, the author introduces some of the most significant works on the subject. Then, he tries to clarify the cognitive virtues of the feminist utopia for a better understanding of gender, sex difference and male domination. The conclusion reconsiders the epistemological and methodological implications of the study.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40030310<br>
Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Martuccelli Danilo<br>
Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Publisher: Philosophy Documentation Center<br>

Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
Issue: i40089818<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: In a period of immanent crisis when comprehensive historical narratives are no longer possible—nor is utopia—dystopia, or rather uchronia tinged with dystopia, seems to be a rather effective means to construct a sweeping historical narration. Through the “timeless time” of uchronia in which—as Ricoeur explains in
         Time and Narrative(vol. III)—“we are torn between two fleeing horizons” so that “our present sees itself in crisis,” Roth looks back at a counterfactual past in order to better investigate historical causality and to embrace past and present into a postmodern problematic perspective on the temporal dimension.<br>
