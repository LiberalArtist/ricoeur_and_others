  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Abstract: I have to apologize—being not a Girardian—when starting with an idea introduced in the text on “Violence and Religion: Cause or Effect?”: “The question of religious violence is first and foremost a human question, . . . and not a directly religious question” (Girard 2004).<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Girard’s reflections have led us to recognize sacred violence as the foundation of Western culture. Sacred violence, in turn, has its roots in mimetic conflicts: the rivals are brothers who are both brought closer and divided by something they both desire. I have also argued that mimetic rivalry is the engine that drives all intellectual symbolism. Thus, the “figure” that represents that symbolism better than any other is that of enemy brothers, who are brothers precisely because they are enemies (or made alike by their reciprocal violent rivalry) and enemies precisely because they are brothers (or rivals inasmuch as each<br>

  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: In 1936 General Francisco Franco and other military leaders revolted against the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, plunging the country into a devastating civil war that would last until 1939. American Roman Catholics faced divided loyalties in trying to stake out positions in the public discourse about the war. Hoping that the Republic would become more democratic, and fearful of Francoʹs ʺcrusade,ʺ some Catholics argued for supporting the new Republican government even in the face of its violence against clerics of the state church.

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Author(s) Graham Tyler<br>
  Abstract: The groundwork for my encounter with the work of René Girard was laid early in my life. I grew up in a tumultuous era that sensitized me to violence. Trips with my parents through the U.S. South enabled me to observe the persistence of Jim Crow in “colored” and “white” schools. Even as a child, I saw and felt that race-based disparities in educational opportunity constituted a reprehensible act of violence. The Vietnam War shaped my experience in high school and college. Especially in college, I brought the resources of my liberal education to bear upon the violence around me.<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history.

  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

  Book Title: Rifle Reports-A Story of Indonesian Independence<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

In central Africa, roadways were filled with thousands of starving, desperate people traveling toward unknown destinations.

Rather than recounting events and extrapolating their meaning to her life within an autobiographical text, such as Michel de Montaigne falling off a horse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau stealing a ribbon, or André Gide travelling to North Africa, Ernaux chooses a specific incident — a love relationship, an abortion, a scene of domestic violence, for example — and describes this in sparse, unlyrical prose with no discussion of its consequences<br>

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

Yet when we attempt to submit its most common form, that of petition, to philosophical analysis, we run into difficulties. All too often we pray for things, such as victory or gaining a desired position, and forget that there are losers in such competitions.

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton.

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Humankind has always seen community and violence as inherently related. Such a relation is, in fact, at the heart of the most important expressions of culture across history, be they of art, literature, or philosophy. The first graffiti etched in prehistoric grottoes depicted the human community through scenes of violence (hunting, sacrifice, battles). So too would war be the theme of the first great poem of Western civilization. Almost all world literatures, from the Hebrew to the Egyptian to the Indian, open with interhuman conflict and its images of violence and death to confirm for us a connection between community<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

  Author(s) Parker Gabrielle<br>
  Abstract: Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed. Another reason for anti-Algerian sentiment was the fact that this labor immigration was organized<br>

  Abstract: Whereas the previous chapter elaborated what might be thought of as a destiny to which we must be answerable, I now turn to another, more active face of skepticism or sin, namely violence. What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  Author(s): GUNN GILES<br>
  Abstract: Over the course of his distinguished interdisciplinary career, Giles Gunn has sustained his focus on the continuing threats to our collective sense of the human that seem to result from the link between the collision of fundamental values and the increase of systemic violence. He asks whether such threats can be at least mitigated, even if not removed, by understanding as opposed to force and what resources a more pragmatic cosmopolitanism might provide for doing so. How, in other words, might our sense of the human be reconstructed, not around suspicion or antipathy toward others, but around an epistemological and moral need of them?<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

  Book Title: The Literatures of the French Pacific-Reconfiguring Hybridity<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Hybridity theory, the creative dissemination and restless to-and-fro of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space or of Stuart Hall’s politics of difference, for example, has opened up understandings of what may be produced in the spaces of cultural contact. This book argues that the particularity of the forms of mixing in the literatures of the French Pacific country of New Caledonia contest and complexify the characterisations of hybrid cultural exchange. From the accounts of European discovery by the first explorers and translations of the stories of oral tradition, to the writings of settler, déporté, convict, indentured labourer and their descendants, and contemporary indigenous (Kanak) literatures, these texts inscribe Oceanian or Pacific difference within and against colonial contexts. In a context of present strategic positioning around a unique postcolonial proposal of common destiny, however, mutual cultural transformation is not unbounded. The local cannot escape coexistence with the global, yet Oceanian literatures maintain and foreground a powerful sense of ancestral origins, of an original engendering. The spiral going forward continually remembers and cycles back distinctively to an enduring core. In their turn, the Pacific stories of unjust deportation or heroic settlement are founded on exile and loss. On the other hand, both the desire for, and fears of, cultural return reflected in such hybrid literary figures as Déwé Gorodé’s graveyard of ancestral canoes and Pierre Gope’s chefferie internally corrupted in response to the solicitations of Western commodity culture, or Claudine Jacques’ lizard of irrational violence, will need to be addressed in any working out of a common destiny for Kanaky-New Caledonia.<br>

  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

The wartime division of friend and enemy, resistor and Nazi, between whom no middle ground was possible, brought intellectuals into a Manichean world in which refusal to choose sides became a choice for an intolerable status quo.

This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  Abstract: My aim in this book has been to explore the link between religion and violence, which I have done through four key symbols employed by commentators and academics convinced that religion often promotes violence. These symbols were: cosmic war, martyrdom, demonization, and warrior empowerment. I engaged dialectically with each of these symbols, using the insights of Bernard Lonergan, and through that engagement, I addressed a number of questions: What are the truthful and mistaken assertions made by authors through the lenses of these symbols around the link between religion and violence? Are there better categories to understand religiously motivated violence?<br>

  Book Title: Enjeux interculturels des médias-Altérités, transferts et violences<br>
  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Moser Walter<br>
  Abstract: Cet ouvrage vise à éclairer deux problématiques actuelles, l'intermédialité - l'interaction des représentations médiatiques - et l'interculturalité - l'interaction des cultures. Trois questions principales guident les contributeurs au volume : Comment les médias se sont-ils inscrits dans le processus actuel de mondialisation culturelle ? Quelles sont les images d'autres cultures qu'ils construisent ? Dans quelle mesure les médias exercent-t-ils une violence par rapport à d'autres cultures qui n'ont pas l'habitude de se représenter dans les genres médiatiques de l'Occident ? Pour y répondre, les auteurs explorent le rôle des médias dans la connaissance de l'Autre, la violence interculturelle et la mondialisation. Ils découvrent que le fil conducteur réside dans la tension entre mondialisation et réappropriation, entre images stéréotypées et images complexes, entre violence médiatique et formes de résistance.<br>

After all, ethnocultural conflicts have been an increasing source of political violence around the world.

According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but, rather, the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism-renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man-has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.<br>

  Abstract: The Grecanici are a Greek linguistic minority in the Calabria region of Italy, remnants of a population that has resided there since late antiquity. Their language represents a holdover from the Middle Ages, at least, and possibly even to the Greek colonies of the classical period. For decades the Grecanici passionately fought to be recognized by the Italian state as an official linguistic minority, finally achieving this goal in 1999. Violence, corruption, and mismanagement are inextricable parts of the social fabric, but Grecanici have crafted the means to invert hegemonic culture and participate in the power games of minority politics.<br>

  Author(s): KALISA CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.<br>

While it can be argued that gendered violence is a corollary to imperialism and colonialism, women writers show how their societies contribute to gendered violence.<br>

  Author(s): Ferrer Carolina<br>
  Abstract: Le thème de la réclusion, cette forme de violence directe qui consiste à limiter la mobilité physique d’un sujet, traverse la littérature. En effet, l’expérience de l’enfermement, de cet espace-temps intermédiaire créé par la contrainte, a inspiré l’œuvre de plusieurs auteurs. Peu importe la forme que prend l’enfermement, fictif ou réel, dans des contextes de violence explicite ou implicite, les écritures de la réclusion mettent au jour les liens entre le politique, le social et le traitement qu’en fait l’art. Les auteurs de cet ouvrage explorent l’expression de la réclusion, que ce soit dans la littérature hispano-américaine postdictatoriale, en particulier dans le roman Le fourgon des fous de l’écrivain uruguayen Carlos Liscano, en contexte antillais dans l’œuvre de Patrick Chamoiseau, dans les classiques africains, dans Lefeu ou la démolition de l’écrivain autrichien Jean Améry, dans les aveux de comploteurs guinéens, dans le contexte du Centre de rééducation civique de Tcholliré au Cameroun ou encore dans l’œuvre du célèbre auteur d’origine togolaise Kossi Efoui. Une entrevue inédite avec ce dernier conclut par ailleurs l’ouvrage, qui offre un cadre large et varié pour réfléchir aux violences institutionnelles faites aux collectivités et aux individus, à leurs modes de fonctionnement et à ce qu’en fait l’art, la littérature en particulier.<br>

  Abstract: Violence against women was neither recognized as a significant problem, nor was it studied empirically, until women’s political action in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the success of grassroots feminist activism in creating hotlines, shelters, and counseling centres for women made men’s violence visible as a widespread social problem and a structural element in gender relations. Thus, in much of Western Europe, addressing violence against women began by creating places of safety and support for victims.<br>

  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

                     pax(peace) andfacere(to make); i.e., to make peace. Pacifism is found from ancient times to the present, among both secular and religious persons, in simple societies as well as in advanced technological states. Pacifism is not to be confused with passivity. Making peace is active—adherents are committed to building a peaceful world.<br>

  Author(s) Powell Mark Allan<br>
  Abstract: The¹ story of the gang rape and mutilation of a Levite’s secondary wife in Judges 19 is indeed a “text of terror,” as Phyllis Trible has argued.² Texts of terror reflect, describe and critique the violence humans inflict upon one another, as well as our ignorance, complicity, and culpability in the brutality and victimization of women and others. Sometimes it is the Divine who is depicted as terrorizing women and their children or as sanctioning violence among humans. We often rationalize that the violence we commit is necessary and different from the violence committed by the internal and external other<br>

  Book Title: The Crucifixion of the Warrior God-Volumes 1 & 2<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Boyd Gregory A.<br>
  Abstract: In an epic constructive investigation, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God addresses the tension between Scripture’s violent depictions of God and the non-violent, self-sacrificial God that was supremely revealed on the cross. Over two volumes, author Gregory A. Boyd develops a theological interpretation of Scripture that he labels a “cruciform hermeneutic," and he argues that this cruciform way of reading Scripture reframes its violent divine portraits in a way that subverts their violence and that discloses how they bear witness to the revelation of God’s non-violent love in the crucified Christ.<br>

  Abstract: Because of my commitment to treat all Scripture as “God-breathed” as well as my commitment to the Conservative Hermeneutical Principle, it is not enough for me to demonstrate how violent depictions of God bear witness to the cross. Since the cross leads me to deny that God acted violently in any biblical narrative of divine judgment, I must offer some alternative account of who brought about the violence that is attributed to God in these narratives. We have seen that this is unproblematic in narratives in which violently inclined people function as instruments of God’s judgments (vol. 2, chs. 16<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

While the Holocaust was to remain marginal to thinking about the war at least until the 1960s, the meaning of mass violence and atrocity was immediately debated by political thinkers across the continent. After all, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s more people had been ‘killed by their fellow human beings than ever before in the history of humankind’.¹<br>

  Book Title: Abraham's Children-Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

It claims a long and unbroken chain from antiquity to the present of the intolerance on the part of religious groups, especially the Abrahamic religions, toward members of other religious groups. It is a narrative of violence, oppression, torture, and war. This highly selective narrative omits any of the goods that religions have brought to the world and is deeply caricatured. Many of its claims are blatantly false. Sadly, because of its influence, it needs to be retold, reconsidered, and reevaluated.<br>

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

The deportations had stopped, incidents of blatant violence had decreased, and Germany’s defeat seemed certain.

  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  Abstract: Case study chapters address the relatively unknown history of South Asian American rhetorical performances from the early 1800s to the present. Avant-garde feminist performances by the Post Natyam dance collective appropriate women's folk practices and Hindu goddess figures make rhetorical claims about hate crimes against South Asian Americans after 9/11. In
      Yoni ki Bat(a South Asian American version ofThe Vagina Monologues) a progressive performer transforms aspects of the Mahabharata narrative to address issues of sexual violence, such as incest and rape. Throughout the volume, Garlough argues that these performers rely on calls for acknowledgment that intertwine calls for justice and care. That is, they embed their testimony in traditional cultural forms to invite interest, reflection, and connection.<br>

Kenneth Schmitz’s philosophy of freedom is, among other things, a move away from modern violence philosophies. Yet with all his classical philosophical commitments, Schmitz is as modern a philosopher as there is, particularly regarding the modern proof of unconditioned freedom.

Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

Making critical use of theory, old and new, Mayer breaks through unexamined assumptions and prevailing debates about the attributes of these particular revolutions to raise broader and more disturbing questions about the nature of revolutionary violence attending new foundations.<br>

The nature of Jewish-Muslim relations, however, changed with the emergence of the Palestine conflict. The first strains in Sunni-Jewish relations appeared with the 1936–39 Arab Revolt. This set the pattern for sporadic violence against Lebanon’s Jews, which was motivated by solidarity with the Palestinians from the 1930s onward.

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence. The pendulum of possible responses swings without pausing from the extreme of traditional retributive justice—requiring investigations, trials, and punishment<br>

  Abstract: In the long run, the uncouth, isolating, reductive, and bodily aspects of the street patterned how veterans knew of, spoke of, and remembered that terrain. They also led many to seek out a refuge like the shelter. The street’s distractions, contingencies, and potential violence amplified fears and anxieties. People oriented themselves on the sensory range between “nervousness” and “staying calm,” with many bedding down in the shelter in hopes of finding more of the latter. “I’m okay. I feel safe as long as I’m in the building,” Joey said when asked how he was doing one day. Greg said that<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  Book Title: The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LEMARCHAND RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: Endowed with natural resources, majestic bodies of fresh water, and a relatively mild climate, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa has also been the site of some of the world's bloodiest atrocities. In Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, decades of colonial subjugation-most infamously under Belgium's Leopold II-were followed by decades of civil warfare that spilled into neighboring countries. When these conflicts lead to horrors such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ethnic difference and postcolonial legacies are commonly blamed, but, with so much at stake, such simple explanations cannot take the place of detailed, dispassionate analysis.
      The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africaprovides a thorough exploration of the contemporary crises in the region. By focusing on the historical and social forces behind the cycles of bloodshed in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, René Lemarchand challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the roots of civil strife in former Belgian Africa. He offers telling insights into the appalling cycle of genocidal violence, ethnic strife, and civil war that has made the Great Lakes region of Central Africa the most violent on the continent, and he sheds new light on the dynamics of conflict in the region. Building on a full career of scholarship and fieldwork, Lemarchand's analysis breaks new ground in our understanding of the complex historical forces that continue to shape the destinies of one of Africa's most important regions.<br>

  Abstract: It is easy to imagine American evangelical Christianity and the ideals of southern manhood in opposition. Nineteenth-century evangelicalism, in the North and the South, has typically been portrayed as women’s domain: women were more in attendance at congregational activities, and pastors bent over backward to accommodate theological ideals to feminine sentimentality even as the culture at large considered women more naturally inclined to spiritual and moral matters than men. Men, in contrast, and especially in the South, were beholden to a code of honor that, among other things, encouraged violence—martial, retributive, or vigilant—gambling, blood sports, sowing wild oats,<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

The essays collected here analyze the background of this problem in contemporary family life and society at large, with special emphasis on the role of women and on the Bible as a source of inspiration and transformation. The collection is the product of a six-year conversation on family, violence, and human dignity between the Protestant Theological University in Kampen, The Netherlands, and the Faculty of Theology at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, a North-South dialogue that included annual conferences, a series of responsive letters, and additional external responses.

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  Book Title: Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier-A Literary Geography of the Putumayo<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYLIE LESLEY<br>
  Abstract: Coming to prominence during the tropical booms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Putumayo has long been a site of mass immigration and exile, of subjugation and insurgency, and of violence. By way of a study of literature of and on the Putumayo by Latin American as well as US and European writers, Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier explores the history and enduring significance of this Amazonian border zone, which has been visited both physically and imaginatively by figures such as Roger Casement, José Eustasio Rivera, and William Burroughs. Travel writing, testimony, diaries, letters, journalism, oral history, songs, photographs, and ‘pulp’ fiction are all considered alongside more conventional forms such as the novel. Whilst geographically peripheral, the Putumayo has played a central role in Colombia and beyond, both historically and, crucial to this study, culturally, producing a literature of extreme experience, marginality, and conflict.<br>

His most important work espousing nonviolence in these years wasThe Kingdom of God Is within You(1893). Nonviolence united Tolstoy’s dreams for a communal brotherhood of man with his increasingly strident opposition to the government and Russian Orthodox church.

They are open to revision and adaptation, including to the input of outside and new forces and actors. For this reason our use of the term ‘local’ does not connote a bounded space that excludes outsiders. Rather,<br>

  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

As will become evident, the degree of exegetical work needed to render these texts as messages of sexual renunciation varied considerably: in some cases, passages stood ready-to-hand for appropriation, while in others, textual displacement, or even textual violence, was necessary to extract an ascetic meaning. I here identify eleven modes of reading, some closely related, that were frequently used by ascetically inclined church fathers.

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory?

  Abstract: What is human Being? I cannot think of anything more effective in urgently provoking one to ask this question than violence. This question has served as an undertone in all the chapters so far, but more noticeably in the last three chapters, with some conspicuous help from Peirce and Heidegger. But in our search for human Being in the world, we keep encountering human beings: the result of the pull of an anthropological attitude against that of a purely philosophical one. Anthropology has had an answer to the question, What is a human being? An answer that has, on the<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: It would be easy to assume that, in the eighteenth century, slavery and the culture of taste--the world of politeness, manners, and aesthetics--existed as separate and unequal domains, unrelated in the spheres of social life. But to the contrary,
         Slavery and the Culture of Tastedemonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

The book ends with the problem of cosmopolitanism.

Its violence exposed the hidden dependency of every way of life—economic, religious, artistic, philosophical—on a political sphere whose practices and disorders accumulate meaning almost imperceptibly over generations. If violence is not to rule public life, each domain must become aware of this dependency and alter itself to accommodate “history.” Even philosophers must learn to

Of course, violence tends, at the end of the day, to be the basis of war, while the other two, being modes of dialogue, are constitutive of politics. But whereas the politics of negotiation aims for accommodation, for resolving conflict through the making of trade-offs and concessions, those who converse strive instead for genuine understanding, for learning from each other and progressively transforming their positions so that they can be not compromised but integrated, reconciled. That is why only conversation is a matter of trying to “convince” people<br>

  Abstract: Rewriting Apocalypse in Contemporary Canadian Fiction is the first book to explore the literary, psychological, political, and cultural repercussions of the apocalypse in the fiction of Timothy Finley, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, Thomas King, and Joy Kogawa. While writers from diverse nations have adopted and adapted the biblical narrative, these Canadian authors introduce particular twists to the familiar myth of the end. Goldman demonstrates that they share a marked concern with purgation of the non-elect, the loss experienced by the non-elect, and the traumatic impact of apocalyptic violence. She also analyzes Canadian apocalyptic accounts as crisis literature written in the context of the Cold War - written against the fear of total destruction.<br>

Even if it is true that not all violent phenomena are political phenomena, we tend to feel quite certain that there could be no politics without violence.

This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities.

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

Violence and punishment as both a media spectacle and a bone-crushing reality have become prominent and influential forces shaping American society. As the boundaries between “the realms of war and civil life have collapsed,” social relations and the public services needed to make them viable have been increasingly privatized and militarized.¹ The logic of profitability works its magic in channeling the public funding of warfare and organized violence into universities, market-based service providers, Hollywood cinema, cable<br>

  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

Although Baroque scholasticism, Marxism and liberation theology agree on notions such as the “the finality of history,” the conflicts of interpretation between Christianism and Marxism have compelled the liberation theologians to reformulate<br>

  Abstract: The truest violence of law is not attributable to its errors, but to its essence. As a structure of meaning and a source of norms, framed through general and abstract standards, law has an especial, inevitable capacity to misrecognise ‘the other’ at the precise moment that the other is in most need of its justice. The significance of the other, upon which Levinas speaks with unparalleled philosophical authority, is instead personal, unique, singular, and fundamental in informing our understanding of ourselves, our desires and our duties. This book addresses law’s difficult task of responding meaningfully to the type of ethical<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on a career-long exploration of 1960s French philosophy, Leonard Lawlor seeks a solution to 'the problem of the worst violence'. Lawlor argues all violence must itself be reduced to its lowest level. He engages with Foucault, Derrida and Deleuze and Guattari to create new ways of speaking to best achieve the least violence.<br>

  Abstract: During the last four months of 1997, the Coast Province of Kenya was under a state of national emergency.

  Abstract: If conflict is an intrinsic feature of democratic politics, then the manifestations of this conflict should be subjected to critical analysis to assess the extent to which they lend themselves to violence. This is particularly important because modern politics – especially in pious democratic forms – tends to deal with these conflicts in ethical terms constructed on a juxtaposition between democracy and violence. For this reason, evaluation of the ethics of conflict is fundamental to the arguments for and against democracy in contemporary politics, in particular the relationship between violence and democracy. Rather than seeing democracy and violence as contrasting<br>

Still under Hobbes’s influence, we might today—perhaps in a fitful, nightmarish sleep—conjure up similar images of law as a frightening, bloodthirsty beast, but with this difference: the modern Leviathan would be as intent on concealing its bloodletting activities, on covering its bloody tracks, as on slaking its deadly thirst.

  Abstract: In this groundbreaking work, Lois Presser investigates the life stories of men who have perpetrated violence. She applies insights from across the academy to in-depth interviews with men who shared their accounts of how they became the people we most fear--those who rape, murder, assault, and rob, often repeatedly. Been a Heavy Life provides the discipline of criminology with two crucial frameworks: one for critically evaluating the construction of offenders own stories, and one for grasping the cultural meta-narratives that legitimize violence. For social scientists generally, this book offers a vivid demonstration of just how dynamic and contingent self-narratives are.<br>

Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

The new South Africa's confrontation of this dilemma is Martin J. Murray's subject in

Freud’s unconscious is a seductive delinquent, always on the go, tracking down desire and its infinite partial objects. Oblivious to debts, to logic and justice, it moves steadily toward death in search of the intervention of a father figure in front of whom it refuses to yield.

Public opinion in the North already cast Brown as a “monomaniac” and murderer, but Thoreau linked him to Puritans and Revolutionary fathers who, unlike enfranchised northern whites, would not sacrifice the principle of equality to expedience. Because the Dred Scott case effectively nationalized slavery, Thoreau argued, Brown’s self-sacrificing violence was needed not only to free<br>

In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence.

  Abstract: An aesthetic paradox of Asian martial arts is that something so warlike in conception should be beautiful to watch and joyful to perform. While designed for violence and visibly expressing that functionality, the martial arts are not practiced with a violent purpose and do no harm (although they certainly could). By suspending the dread of violence, the practice creates a theater in which to contemplate movements combining artful design with eloquent efficacy. But if you remove the training conventions and introduce unfeigned violence (as in boxing), the aesthetic serenity will vanish into the sometimes irrepressibly fascinating chaos of violence.<br>

  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state.

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican visual culture appears here in a series of case studies taken in historical slices from the seventeenth century to the end of the twentieth century. Cosmopolitanism is understood here as an evolving complex of power relations with material, social, ideational, and affective manifestations, which unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. To associate cosmopolitanism with power is to suggest its compatibility with violence. I propose that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization generated and structured power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent<br>

  Abstract: In

Via critical analysis of writers and filmmakers whose projects have changed our ways of viewing the modern world-including Hannah Arendt, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, the directors ofGermany in Autumn, and Heiner Mueller-these essays furnish a cultural base for contemporary discussions of totalitarian domination, lying and politics, the relation between law and body, the relation between law and justice, the question of violence, and our ways of conceptualizing "the human."<br>

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer. Cecilia Hatt gained her D.Phil from Oxford University.<br>

Abstract: This latest book by France’s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. The book, first, engages in a sustained critique of the illusions that philosophy falls into when it ignores the historical, social, and economic conditions of its objects and its own existence. He is particularly concerned with the errors that arise from collapsing practical, embodied, everyday ways of knowing into theoretical models of knowledge, though he also criticizes forms of false universalism in morality and aesthetics, which ignore the empirical realities of differential distributions of economic and cultural capital and of access to the requisite dispositions and interests required for political and cultural participation. Second, the book provides a critique of current social‐scientific methodologies, while promoting Bourdieu’s preferred “reflexive realism,” intended to avoid both objectivism and relativism through a radical historicization of social‐scientific reason itself. Unfortunately, this section lacks the sustained, careful argumentation that philosophers of social science might wish for. Third, the last three—and strongest—chapters present Bourdieu’s leading concepts and basic social analyses: “habitus” as an agent’s embodied, affectively conditioned practical knowledge and dispositions; social space as differentiated into fields of symbolic struggle over cultural capital; the reproduction of social order through dialectical attunement between objective structures and habitus; and the symbolic violence arising from differential access to the means and sites for defining the categories and stakes of symbolic fields. The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu’s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.<br>

Abstract: One of the most contentious issues that Neal had to deal with in volume 3 concerned the role of the Puritans in the trial and execution of Charles I. He insists that neither Puritanism itself nor the tenets of any group among the Puritans were responsible for the death of Charles I. The seizure of the king by the army and the subsequent purging of parliament, Neal says, “blew up the whole constitution, and buried king, parliament, and presbytery in its ruins.” Episcopal divines, “in order to throw off the king’s misfortunes from themselves, who by their obstinate behaviour had in reality reduced him to the last extremity,” diverted all blame onto the Puritan clergy—as their successors have continued to do to this day, he adds.
      35Neal has no difficulty in presenting detailed evidence of public statements, petitions, and letters from Puritan ministers in London and throughout the country protesting against the trial of the king and subsequently against his sentence and his execution. Neal says that he knows of only two ministers—Hugh Peters and John Goodwin—who did support the trial and execution of the king. “King Charles therefore died by the Hands of Violence, or by the military Sword, assumed and managed in an arbitrary manner by a few desperate Officers of the Army and their Dependants, of sundry Denominations as to Religion, without any regard to the ancient Constitution of their Country, or the fundamental Laws of Society.”36Neal is adamant that “the king’s death was not owing to the distinguishing tenets of any sect or party of Christians,”37and he provides further corroboration from contemporaries to reinforce this challenge to the received wisdom of churchmen past and present. The strongest evidence is the act of attainder of the king’s judges drawn up at the time of the restoration of Charles II.38This judgment makes clear that no specific religious party can be held responsible for the execution of Charles I. Nor does it ascribe responsibility to the~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Martin Heidegger offered an operative concept of the ontotheological constitution of metaphysics, thinkers have been obsessed with overcoming it. Ontotheology has been blamed for any number of ills and its overcoming deemed the way to escape the injustice, violence, blasphemy, or manipulation from which God, self, world, and the Other suffer. According to Jeffrey Robbins, however, the project of overcoming ontotheology is not only misguided but dangerous, for, whatever form it takes, it aims at an imaginary purity.<br>

Abstract: To trouble the categories of biological kinship, Haraway draws on the figure of the vampire. The vampire “both promises and threatens racial and sexual mixing” and “feeds off the normalized human” (
         1997b, 214). Suggestive of violence, pollution, and mixing, the vampire is a figure for the alien, the immigrant, and the cosmopolitan and is embroiled in racism, sexism, and homophobia. The figure of the vampire clearly facilitates Haraway’s inquiry into leakages among kinship categories. Yet like the cyborg, the figure also tends to become, like whiteness, everything and nothing at once. Haraway asks, in response toTimemagazine’s 1993 cover of a morphed portrait of a woman’s face created by a computer mixing of different races, a figure she labels SimEve, “Nothing here is scary, so why am I trembling?” (1997b, 264). In a similar manner, I ask about the figure of the vampire: Everything is so messy, so why am I so suspicious? My suspicion arises from the ease with which Haraway’s use of the vampire allows us to be on the other side of kinship and the dramas of identity and reproduction. As Haraway concludes in her chapter, “I believe that there will be no racial or sexual peace, no livable nature, until we learn to produce humanity through something more and less than kinship. I think I am on the side of the vampires, or at least some of them” (1997b, 265). But where and how, within the specific matrices of racial and gendered/sexual oppression, can vampirism be a choice? I suggest that like the postmodern figure of the cyborg, the vampire, recuperated metaphorically for illegitimacy and racial crossing, can function to metaphorize the specificities of race and sex out of existence and once again make room for universalizing analogy.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: It appears, then, that, in addition to mutual recognition of free participatory agency as its necessary precondition, a solidary interreligious relationship within the postcolonial‐neocolonial context also requires mutual recognition of identity or worth. The damage to self‐esteem inflicted upon a community and its members and the consequent festering of resentment in the wake of a recognition of worth withheld could be destructive to any efforts made to establish the conditions of coexistence and solidary action necessary for creating a peaceable polity—however loosely it may be meant—in opposition to the violence of today’s global order. Nevertheless, in spite of its historical‐contextual justification and exigency, there is something self‐contradictory about the notion of recognition on demand, that is, recognition given to certain values and practices solely on account of their uniqueness and difference. Recognition, as re‐cognition, implies the seeing, remembering, and rediscovering of oneself in another and therefore involves by definition some assessment and evaluation of another from one’s existing perspective and criteria, for both individuals and communities. Charles Taylor’s pioneering essay on the politics of recognition shows how a suppression of this fact actually results in nonrecognition. If one's recognition of another is produced purely by the force of will following a sense of moral imperative to respect difference as such, it is patronizing if not downright condescending: I do not know why or on what grounds I should recognize you, but I will grant you recognition anyway because you need it.
         28Furthermore, as long as one cannot do away with one’s perspective and criteria of evaluation, such a patronizing recognition degenerates into hypocrisy in case the object of recognition does not meet the criteria: “I know deep down in my heart that you do not really deserve it, but …” Indeed the specter of recognition in bad faith returns here with~<br>

Abstract: The large percentage of Americans
         21who identify as fundamentalist or evangelical Christians and who worship at churches like the one associated with Eternal Grace carry with them a kind of theological certainty that both endows them with humility in the face of God’s greatness but also promotes a kind of hubris in the presumption of knowing God’s plan. This certainty also engenders complacency, a troubling aspect of this religious collective memory.22What, after all, does it mean when a large percentage of the American populace adheres to a worldview that negates the importance of intervening in history? As Barbara Rossing writes in her (2004) book,The Rapture Exposed, this kind of faith “leads to ‘appalling ethics’ … because the faithful are relieved of concern for the environment, violence, and everything else except their personal salvation” (as quoted in Moyers2005). Most of the students in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom certainly seemed caught in this theological pitfall, being unwilling as they were to even consider saving Jews when asked to imagine living during the Holocaust.<br>

Abstract: To the ear of a theological ethicist, however, this emphasis on children’s agency raises significant questions. The notion that agency defines what it means to be human has profound problems even when it comes to adults. Postmodern ethics of various kinds has shown that human life in society is fundamentally conditioned by a number of non‐agential factors. These include historical and cultural traditions, shared social narratives, systems of power, commitments to common goods, biological and evolutionary needs, intersubjective norms of dialogue and relationship, transcending sources of social meaning, and needs for receptivity and responsiveness toward persons and cultures that are other. Jürgen Habermas argues that since ethics confronts human life with a “pluralism of ultimate value orientations,” it must be grounded ultimately not in the expression of subjective agency but in procedures of larger “intersubjective discourse” that allow for mutual dialogue to arise and flourish between diverse points of view.
         38Ricoeur has criticized one‐sided ethics of agency as masking the mere utilitarian pursuit of self‐interest in which the powerless silently lose out.39More emphatically, Levinas has shown how the ethics of agency can be used to justify social violence (Levinas himself was a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust) in permitting those with the greatest social agency to “totalize” shared moral worlds. Ethics should begin, according to Levinas, in agency’s very opposite: the otherness of the other calling the self to “a passivity more passive still than the passivity of matter.”40<br>

Abstract: All I have claimed here, however, is that moral practice involves, even if it is not exhausted by, a primordial creative capability. However such a capability may be realized substantively, my point has been to argue, against a long history in Western moral thought, that such a capability is not ancillary or hostile to moral practice but rather presupposed within it. Poetics is the condition for ethical life’s transformative possibility. What it means to be an
         imitatio Creatorisis to be capable of imitating an invisible and dynamic creativity deeply impressed in the human will. This original human creative capability is absolutely necessary for forming worlds of moral meaning that may overcome historical distortions and violence and respond to human difference. Without it we are likely to retreat into unchanging moral certainties or a simplistic moral pluralism. The more profoundly human possibility is to engage in the endless but ultimately more rewarding task of creating real historical tensions into ever more meaningfully inclusive moral worlds.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Abstract: Overriding the detective prototype, such is the courtship novel in its most attenuated and dilatory form. Failing all lived cultural totality, failing even a structural unity capable of being mapped back onto the rendered world, the violence of this Dickensian ending is to settle for individual union at all costs, whatever unethical deceits must be prolonged, whatever truth must be deferred. Need it be said? The obvious alternative in the case of
         Little Dorritwould clearly have been less manageable by plot or genre. For Clennam to come to the marriage altar (as ethical reward for selfless devotion) to find it a symbolic baptismal font as well (the epistemological redemption of the abused child by a corrected parentage) would not have made for a readily stabilized closure in the marriage-plot mode. Rather, it would have left the hero with too much on his mind: an entirely reconstituted subjectivity, in fact, to be actively grappled with and rethought, rather than just a depleted self to be sunk gratefully in another. The failure of dialectical resolution is absolute. Forget social totality. Forget even formal unity. To stave off all further worry over the hero's status as son, his union, its figured prospects feminized, is reduced to the unitary.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: Recall that the great insight of the Hellenistic and early Christian humanists, as Werner Jaeger recounted it, was to think through the opposition. As he noted, “Theology was intended from the very beginning to transcend humanism but at the same time it was the true fulfillment of the task which humanism had formulated.”
         38A “theology” implied apaideiaor a form of education that provided orientation to individuals and societies. Further, the biblical religions and the modern critics of religion advanced the insight that life, the flourishing of existence, and not death can and must orient human action. The task is to overcome the alienation of life from itself. More provocatively, I contend that the call of conscience to that task arises through the tensions among remembrance and love and is itself testimony to the life of our life, a vitality construed theologically as the “God” who communicates life and invigorates freedom and responsibility for new life. The remembrance of death is indeed at the origins of the sense of responsibility. I am bound to orient my power responsibly rooted in the vulnerability of mortal being—my own and that of others—to violence. Yet when one interrogates the complexity of religious symbols and practices along with the dynamics of mortal experience inscribed in the love of life, one can come to see, I submit, that the purpose of responsibility is to respect and enhance the integrity of life. Power ought to serve the integrity of life; responsibility is power so oriented and exercised.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Abstract: Grégoire's activities after 1789 exacerbated such tensions, as the convergence of Christian and republican values he espoused collapsed in the wake of political and religious violence. This outcome, moreover, was at least partly predetermined by opposing tendencies within the universalist project. Sepinwall argues that “just as the abbé had suggested before the Revolution that Jews needed to transform themselves to become fully integrated into society, he now envisioned a similar process for other groups, such as dialect speakers and nonwhites”—and, ultimately, for women as well. Grégoire's aspirations also extended to the Church itself. As constitutional bishop of Loir-et-Cher, he aimed to achieve among his flock a total regeneration of moral, religious, intellectual, and physical faculties. The social order, having emancipated itself from the traditional hierarchies of the ancien régime, could in turn “create a unitary people where one did not yet exist.” The universalist orientation of this enterprise, of course, made regional differences suspect. As both Sepinwall and Bell have noted, the eradication of patois, originally the ambition of proselytizing clerics, was likewise perceived as necessary for the protection of republican homogeneity (Sepinwall, 81–108, quotes on 87–88, 91).<br>

Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: In engaging the aporias Agamben articulates, a theologian laboring to consider the political and the theological together should pay heed to Horace’s playwriting advice: do not bring a god into the narrative unless the plot’s problem merits the god’s entrance. The theologian must avoid the temptation to absorb the sphere of the political into the theological and to first consider how forces and agents immanent to the political can attend to the problems facing it. This should not avoid the important insights of Schmitt and others that find that modern political philosophy often has drawn its breath from secularized theological and ecclesiological concepts. Nevertheless, it would do considerable violence to political thought to demand that it depend in its entirety upon prophetic criticism and the form‐without‐form of divine judgment. Instead, we must look for the way that prophetic judgment and its concept of promise has immanent effect and the way that promise itself mediates between the divine gift and the immanent reciprocal gift. This way will articulate a relationship between the theological and the political that continues in the correlational tradition. Once again, it is promise and its being that will permit these connections; we will rely on the interaction and interruption of the promise.<br>

Abstract: Here, we come a bit closer to the seductive nature of Augustinian rhetoric. Deprived of clock time, the “since the day I learnt of you” turns into the magic of memory and oblivion. A-causally and counterintuitively it is a world turned upside down. Memory and time (
      ex quo) function asle marteau sans maître, the “hammer of existence,”esse solum, that is ordered as well as given and is incapable of not being confessed and lived, the song that cannot be silenced and cannot disappear from memory and expectation. Oblivion is the silent performance of precisely that: the loss of sound, as a means of survival—in sinful forgetfulness—vis-à-vis that “beauty so old and so new” contained in the ultimate expression of time as present: the temporality of thesero te amavi. But what exactly is being expressed in thesero te amavi? Moreover, if this simultaneity of memory and oblivion is expressed, that is still not the same as the divine voice sounding on its own account. Here, we touch upon the ultimate enigma ofConfessions: the hammer of existence, “Da quod iube, iube quod vis”/“Grant what you command and command what you will.”
            Who is able to withstand the lure—and violence—of that song that, as far as sonority is concerned, cannot be distinguished from the “beauty so old and so new”? One is reminded of Kafka here—the hammer of existence—and his story of the Sirens' song:22
         
            It would be little respectful to Kafka and Augustine to make one-to-one comparisons between this passage and the AugustinianProof that inadequate, even childish measures may come to the rescue.
            To protect himself from the Sirens, Ulysses put wax in his ears and had himself chained to the mast of his ship. Of course, all travelers before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens had already allured from afar, but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever.

Abstract: Peter van der Veer engages the issue of how to approach morality and whether there is a distinctively new anthropological approach. Noting that there are moral universals but that they are applied in distinctively different ways across cultures, he offers India as an instance of moral relativism related to a hierarchical social system. Although I am uncertain that the hierarchical values of obligation, status, innate constitution, and disposition are not themselves moral, I agree with his argument for connecting political economy and moral economy, for this is the surest way to highlight the omnipresence of moral ambiguity, ambivalence, argument, and appraisal, as well as the situatedness of moral action in social life. However, when van der Veer asserts that there is not a new field of study emerging around morality, it is unclear whether he means that the cluster of approaches I outline do not constitute a coherent set of interests or that they should not. Certainly the approach I refer to as “local moral worlds” somewhat predates the others, but in general these authors appear to
         thinkthey are establishing a field rather than just addressing a topic. Personally, I am not a proponent of any of them but am pointing out something I think is necessary if there were to be a coherent approach. I also agree that we should not take recourse to evil as a metaphysical object, which is precisely why I elaborate it as an existential category instead. Recognizing this would allow van der Veer to remove the scare quotes from “evil” in his final sentences. When the neighbors next to whom one must live after the violence are part of the evil, the need to hold one’s tongue is not a problem of silenceinsteadof evil. An alternative to the proverb cited by van der Veer might be the statement of Martin Luther King: “I was not afraid of the words of the violent, but of the silence of the honest.”<br>

Abstract: This is not to say that empathy is given no value in Shakespeare’s play. (As egocentric as it may be, Lear’s empathy is at least an attempt at relation.) It is to say, however, that empathy’s limitations are everywhere implied. As Jonathan Dollimore remarks, the king who commits himself to the cause of “windowless poverty” after coming to “feel what wretches feel,” draws attention to the difficulty of seeking social justice in fellow feeling: the majority is bound to remain poor, naked, and wretched if a king must share the suffering of his subjects in order to “care.”
      
            In the end, empathy cannot produce an ethical society—or even prevent an unethical one. As Levinas explains, empathy is incapable of preventing bad acts because its ethical effects diminish as soon as we tell ourselves that some people are not “really” the same as us, that some people are not as fully human as are we.33
         
            This is what the Nazis claimed of the Jews, and this is what Lear claims of his “pelican daughters” (3.4.70). Lear feels justified in offering violence to Regan and Goneril because he has determined that they are not persons but predators (wolves, foxes, serpents, curs). As is evident in the king’s chilling “Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!” (4.5.177), empathy is an inadequate ground for ethics because it is too easily qualified or set aside. If Lear is to be brought more fully into the realm of the ethical, something more will be required. Instead of encountering the neighbor as an alter ego (to be given equal consideration), Lear must encounter him as an other (to be given all). What is needed is not empathy but awe.34

Abstract: The working of metaphor in
      The Duchess of Malfiand other early modern tragedies lays the foundation for the genre’s and the culture’s representations of violence. The associative and interpretive aspects of metaphor create discourse communities that understand pain as a meaningful experience with affective consequences beyond physical empathy. As a result, all forms of violence are potentially meaningful or even coercive. InThe Duchess of Malfi, the tortures Ferdinand proposes for his sister and Antonio are made meaningful through metaphor, as he imagines forms of violence that target the aspects of her crime that he finds most repulsive:
            The coal-pit scenario stems from a reaction against the possibility that heaven might bless their marriage, as suggested by the Duchess during the actual

                  Or dippe the sheetes they lie in, in pitch or sulphure,

The burning imagery from both this and the following vision recall the characterization of lust as a fire that consumes an individual, making it appropriate that Ferdinand would use the sheets from their bed as a tool of murder. The murder of the child becomes an indictment of the lust that created it as well as an echo of the ghastly practice of feeding a parent his or her own children seen in Seneca’sThyestesand Shakespeare’sTitus Andronicusas perhaps the ultimate form of revenge.

Abstract: Originally “[L]es actes de violence, mais aussi les illogismes, les faux raisonnements, les fausses garanties qui prétendent les compenser ou les justifier. … Les conquérants étaient de ceux qui avaient subi le plus grand génocide de l'histoire. De ce génocide, les sionistes avaient fait un
         mal absolu. Mais transformer le plus grand génocide de l'histoire en mal absolu, c'est une vision religieuse et mystique, ce n'est pas une vision historique. Elle n'arrête pas le mal; au contraire, elle le propage, elle le fait tomber sur d'autres innocents, elle exige une réparation qui fait subir à ces autres une partie de ce que les juifs ont subi (l'expulsion, la mise en ghetto, la disparition comme peuple). Avec des moyens plus froids que le génocide, on veut aboutir au même résultat."(italics added). Gilles Deleuze, “Grandeur d'Arafat,”Revue d'études palestiniennes,no. 10 (Winter 1984), pp. 41–43.<br>

Abstract: Examination of two texts generated by the student massacre at the Plaza de Tlatelolco in 1968:
            Postdataby Octavio Paz, andLa noche de Tlatelolcoby Elena Poniatowska. Paz's totalizing vision interprets the events as providing answers to the questions about the nation posed inEl laberinto de la soledad, and he insists on the need to rewrite Mexico's history under the aegis of a new genealogy. Poniatowska's book, instead, is ruled by fragmentation and plurality, to convey the often dissonant voices of civil society. The analysis scrutinizes literary form as it is made to represent relations between violence, justice and aesthetics.<br>

Article Title: The Textual Mediation of Denial: Congress, Abu Ghraib, and the Construction of an Isolated Incident<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: sp.2011.58.issue-2<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: La musique offre des ressources spécifiques à l'élaboration des mémoires. Elle fournit en particulier des « traces », au sens que donne Paul Ricœur à ce terme, capables de rappeler, dans et pour le présent, des aspects du passé oubliés ou reniés. En Afrique du Sud, cette capacité de la musique à rendre disponibles des traces, à surmonter les oublis, acquiert une importance particulière car s'y déploie une concurrence mémorielle qui oppose un passé de divisions et de violence à un passé d'interactions et de partage. Dans la période qui a suivi l'abolition de l'apartheid, on a assisté à une floraison d'initiatives favorisant des retrouvailles musicales, de nouvelles appropriations et des croisements fructueux. Des traces musicales de métissages et d'enrichissements mutuels passés y abondent. Dans la perspective d'une politique de réconciliation qui ne serait pas simplement juridique et formelle, la musique pourrait donc fournir à la fois un terrain de pratiques et un sujet d'enseignement susceptibles de faciliter l'avènement de l'harmonie sociale que suppose l'idéal d'une nouvelle Afrique du Sud. Il y faudrait toutefois une volonté politique, traduite en politiques publiques, qui fait actuellement défaut.<br>

Abstract: A small section of the Goan elite sought political and civil rights and founded the Partido Indiano (Indian Party) in 1865 in the village of Orlim. It enjoyed mass support particularly of the local Catholics. The rival party was the pro-establishment Partido Ultramarino. The violence that ensued in Margao in 1890 during the municipal elections is known as the 21 September Revolt. It lasted for a mere 20 minutes though the military firing killed 12 persons on the spot besides injuring many more. Protest meetings were held not just in Goa but also in Bombay, Poona, Karachi and Zanzibar. Even the Canadian and American press condemned the brutality and carried news on the "Goa Revolution". This article brings out the history of that revolt in the context of the working of colonialism in Goa.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo analiza las revistas argentinas El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación y La Causa Peronista, editadas por la organización Montoneros desde abril a septiembre de 1974, y Movimiento, ligada a la Juventud Peronista Lealtad durante el mismo periodo. Asumiendo que las tradiciones no constituyen legados cerrados sino herencias en constante invención, se explora la significación que dichas publicaciones articularon sobre el peronismo. ¿Qué sentido se otorgaba al vínculo con Juan Domingo Perón en cada revista? ¿Cómo se pensaba la relación con el resto de los actores del Movimiento Peronista? ¿Qué papel se atribuía a la violencia? Respondiendo dichos interrogantes, se examina el modo en que cada espacio configuró su identidad política. The article analyzes the Argentinean magazines El Peronista Lucha por la Liberación and La Causa Peronista, published by Montoneros organization from April to September 1974, and Movimiento para la Reconstrucción y la Liberación Nacional, tied to the Juventud Peronista Lealtad during this period. Assuming that the traditions do not constitute closed legacies but inheritances in continuous re-invention, the article explores the meaning that those publications presented on the Peronism. What sense was granted to the link by Juan Domingo Perón in every magazine? How was thought the relationship with the other actors of the Movimiento Peronista? What position was assumed around the political violence? Answering the above mentioned questions, the article examines the way in which each organization formed its political identity.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: Confrontant les thèses des anthropologues qui ont tendance à voir dans la mafia une structure plurielle, informelle, dispersée sur le territoire, très dépendante de chaque chef de cellule mafieuse (cosche) et se regroupant à des fins pratiques (task oriented), et les thèses des juges palermitains qui ont tendance à considérer la mafia comme une organisation centralisée de type Cosa nostra, l'auteur montre qu'une analyse dynamique permet de dépasser la confrontation. Ainsi en étudiant les capacités d'adaptation de l'organisation et les différents vecteurs qu'elle peut utiliser (violence marché), il déplace les enjeux du débat et repense le phénomène mafieux dans son rapport à l'État en suivant une problématique weberienne. Haciendo una comparación de las tésis de los antropólogos que tienen la tendencia a ver en la mafia una estructura plural, informal, dispersa en el territorio, muy dependiente de los capos de las células mafiosas, (cosche) y que se reagrupan con objetivos prácticos (task oriented), con las tesis de los jueces palermitanos, inclinados a considerar a la mafia como una organización centralizada de tipo Cosa nostra, el autor muestra que un análisis dinámico permite sobrepasar la confrontación. Asi, estudiando la capacidad de adaptación de la organización y de los diferentes vectores (violencia-mercado) desplaza los terminos del debate, hace el re-examen del fenómeno mafioso en relación con el Estado, siguiendo las pautas de una problemática weberiana. Confronting (comparing) on the one hand anthropologists thesis who have a tendency to see in mafia a plural structure, informal, spread out on the territory, very depending upon their local chiefs (cosche) and meeting for task oriented, and on the other hand the palermitan judges who have a certain tendency to consider mafia as a Cosa Nostra centralized organization type, the author shows that a dynamic analysis allows to go further than confrontation. So, in studying the adaptation capacities of the orga~<br>

Abstract: Contre les excès de l'individualisme libéral et l'incapacité des politiques sociales de résoudre les problèmes, les communautariens proposent de reconstruire le modèle social sur le lien intercommunautaire. Critiquant le modèle libéral/universaliste de dénier toute diversité au profit de l'individu prétendument neutre mais qui ne représente en fait que les préoccupations d'un homme blanc et hétérosexuel, ils proposent un modèle de la reconnaissance centré sur la "reconnaissance de la valeur égale" de chaque culture. Mais face à la question multiculturelle, leur attitude n'est pas dépourvue ambiguïtés, ce qui entraîne des risques de discrimination, d'affrontement et de violence. Against the excesses of liberal individualism and the incapacity of social policies to resolve the resulting problems, communitarians suggest rebuilding social relations on the basis of an intercommunitarian link. Criticizing the liberal/universalist model because it denies diversity for the sake of individualism (which claims to be neutral, but in fact represents the interests of White and Black heterosexual man), communitarians propose a model of recognition based on the "acknowledgment of equal value" of every culture. However when facing multicultural issues, their attitude tends to become ambiguous and involves risks of discrimination, and thus of confrontation and, ultimately, violence.<br>

Author(s): Azevedo Valérie Robin<br>
Abstract: À Huancapi, dans les Andes du sud du Pérou, de nombreux témoignages attestent les apparitions miraculeuses du saint patron à l'époque de la violence politique des deux dernières décennies du XXe siècle. Comment comprendre ces récits qui portent sur des épisodes concrets de la guerre qui opposa l'armée régulière aux maoïstes du Sentier lumineux, et dans lesquels le saint patron se présenta aux différents acteurs armés pour les dissuader de malmener les villageois? Il s'agit d'analyser ici le discours politico-religieux de ces narrations ainsi que le singulier « travail de mémoire » de la guerre qu'elles contiennent. Nous voyons de quelle manière ces mémoires sanctifiées participent de l'élaboration d'une mémoire collective héroïque qui réinterprète autrement l'expérience douloureuse vécue par les habitants de Huancapi durant la guerre. In Huancapi, in the Andes of southern Peru, many people have testified to the miraculous apparitions of the village's patron saint during the war that ravaged the region during the last two decades of the twentieth century. How should these narratives be understood as they evoke specific episodes of a recent, violent history in which St. Luis apparently appeared to the conflict's different protagonists to discourage them from victimizing the villagers? We analyze the political and religious discourse embedded in these narratives and the singular “work on memories” of the war that it unveils. We show how the outstanding figure of the Saint participated in the development of an iconic memory: a heroic and victorious memory that offers another reading of the painful experience of the villagers. En Huancapi, en los Andes del sur del Perú, varios testimonios confirman las apariciones milagrosas del santo patrono durante la época de la violencia política de las dos últimas décadas del siglo XX. ¿Cómo entender estos relatos acerca de episodios concretos de la guerra que opuso el ejército peruano con los maoístas de Sendero luminoso, en los cu~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917930<br>
Date: 9 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Whitehouse Glenn<br>
Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines an account of 'theological humanism' as a new form of theology of culture. I trace the connection between theological humanism and an ethics of responsibility dedicated to respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. I argue that without a 'theological' humanism we risk the reduction of values to human purposes, and yet without a theological 'humanism' religious conviction is unconstrained by moral purpose. In our age of religious violence and ecological crisis, what is needed in ethics is a renewed vision of the moral vocation of human beings not against but within the wider compass of life on earth.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922199<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Schleicher Marianne<br>
Abstract: Responding to the ethical and performative call of Judith Butler not to propagate the sex- and gender-related violence of the imbedded discourse that we study, this article inquires into the discursive strategies of Jewish scripture by analysing how it orchestrates certain norms of sex and gender and makes them serve the overall aim of securing cultural survival. Following this, it traces reflections on persons of ambiguous or indeterminate sex from rabbinic to modern Judaism so as to inquire into the rabbinic dependency on scripture when non-conforming individuals challenge its bipolar sex and gender system. Finally, the article considers if scripture, as suggested by Butler, can play a subversive role in how we attend to non-conforming others today. To do so, the author's distinction between hermeneutical and artifactual uses of scripture is presented to evaluate the extent to which modern Jews and non-Jews are able to influence their own representations of sex and gender and thus liberate themselves from the normativity implied by scriptural discourse.<br>

Author(s): Guggenberger Wilhelm<br>
Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Publisher: University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i24243336<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Licops Dominique<br>
Abstract: Dans la littérature antillaise, les métaphores naturelles symbolisent la conception de l'identité des mouvements littéraires: l'arbre de la négritude, le rhizome de l'antillanité, la mangrove de la créolité. C'est en transformant cette pratique que Gisèle Pineau "s'insère dans le débat théorique littéraire actuel" (Florence Ramond Jurney). En effet, si ses confrères remplacent une image naturelle par une autre en arguant que cette dernière représente plus justement l'identité antillaise, Pineau réfléchit à la violence inhérente à la structure métaphorique en inventant ce que j'appelle une "métaphore imbriquée." Que ce soit l'arbre dans L'Exil selon Julia (1997) ou le cyclone dans L'Espérance-macadam (1995), j'analyserai d'abord comment ces métaphores imbriquées révèlent les effets nuisibles de cette conceptualisation sur les personnages. Ensuite, je considérerai comment, à travers cette figure stylistique, l'auteure pense autrement l'identité antillaise. Enfin, j'envisagerai comment sa réflexion sur l'identité culturelle via les images naturelles a évolué dans ses romans plus récents.<br>

Issue: i24256635<br>
Date: 5 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Helcinel Gaston<br>
Abstract: On a déjà noté, chez Badiou, l'emphase qui salue les rebellions et les révolutions. Il est
curieux quand même de le voir, comme Bourdieu, enthousiaste pour « les millions de manifes-
tants de décembre 1995 qui se réclamaient, comme Paul Celan, du mot-tente "Ensemble" »
(p. 141; l'allusion à Celan vient d'un poème de ce dernier analysé dans les pages qui précè-
dent). Estimer, à rebours de ce jugement emphatique, que les marcheurs réclamaient surtout le
maintien de l'État-providence et les avantages acquis de la démocratie bourgeoise ne saurait
être ici qu'une réflexion de réactionnaire incurable... À propos de Celan, Badiou décèle chez
lui la surrection d'une « altérité » dans la fraternité, contrairement aux frères (révolutionnaires)
mis en scène par Saint-John Perse, qui fusionnent dans la conquête et la violence. Mais il n'en
tire apparemment aucune conclusion (p. 128-139).<br>

Mais comment éviter l'injustice ? On peut distinguer diverses figures de l'étranger – le voyageur, l'immigré, le réfugié – et différencier les droits dont il peut se réclamer. Mais cela est-il suffisant au regard d'une exigence éthique de l'hospitalité ?<br>

Abstract: Voir mon compte rendu de Voix off (Esprit, novembre 2008). Denis Podalydès, qui joue le
personnage de Nicolas Sarkozy dans un film sorti sur les écrans en mai 2011 (c'est l'accession à
la présidence qui est mise en scène dans La Conquête), parle ainsi de la voix du président de la
République: «Je répugnais à m'appuyer sur ses tics, mais je l'ai bien écouté afin de trouver son
rythme, ce point d'autorité dans la voix. C'est un homme qui peut vite passer de la violence à
l'extrême séduction. Ses moments d'enfance sont précieux aussi, ce "hein!" qui affleure lorsqu'il
est heureux de sa répartie. Je l'ai vu sur des images, lorsqu'il se prépare à entrer en meeting et
oublie les photographes. Cette concentration, cette solitude sont celles des comédiens avant
d'entrer en scène», dans Le Monde magazine, 9 janvier 2011.<br>

Abstract: Le mot appartenance contient cette ambiguïté qui se manifeste par les prépositions
qui l'accompagnent « à » et « de ». La proximité entre l'appartenance « à » et l'appartenance
« de » paraît justifier le fait d'exiger la propriété et la violence première sur lesquelles l'État
se soutient, quand, en fait, une nationalité marque plutôt « où » l'on appartient, plus que ce
qui nous appartient.<br>

Publisher: Wilfrid Laurier University Press<br>
Issue: i24465850<br>

Author(s): Gandsman Ari<br>
Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i24517619<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Bracher Nathan<br>
Abstract: The present article argues that Hélène Berr's Journal goes well beyond mere testimony to provide an astute analysis not only of the persecutory measures, arrests, camps, and deportations but also of the various attempts to camouflage the violence and even of the wider implications of what she ultimately recognized to be a systematic extermination. Hélène Berr thus presents an extraordinary case of a young French Jewish student at the Sorbonne who, steeped in literature but untrained in history, nevertheless achieved a degree of historical lucidity that, in view of the confused, limited, and often unreliable information available to her in Nazi-occupied Paris, we can only consider as remarkable. Above all, Hélène Berr's very personal confrontation with history, as it unfolded in all the sinister complexity of what we now know as the Holocaust, enables us to better understand these events in the human terms in which they were experienced and with the ethical dimensions that they take on for us today.<br>

Abstract: Comme l'écrit Ralph Ellison, « l'une des méthodes adoptée par la famille
noire du Sud pour protéger l'enfant est la correction physique violente [...] Un
enfant comme Wright était battu pour son bien; un bien auquel l'enfant
résistait. Les relations familiales étaient ainsi sous-tendues par la peur et
l'hostilité, ce qui différencie qualitativement les relations que l'on trouve dans
les familles patriarcales petites-bourgeoises parce qu'ici la correction est
administrée par la mère, ce qui ne laisse à l'enfant aucun refuge parental. Il doit
toujours accepter la violence en même temps que la tendresse maternelle ou, de
manière désespérée, rejeter la mère ». Cité par P. Gilroy, The Black Atlantic...,

Abstract: Starting point here is what Jesus tells Martha at the death of Lazarus: 'He who believes in
me, though he die, yet shall he live' (John 11:25). The inviolable of human being is the faith in
this Christ, the Christ who commanded Lazarus to return from death. This faith is inviolable to
the extent that not only illness, decay, violence and betrayal have no power over it; it is
unassailable even in death and at the Last Judgment.<br>

Abstract: Dans sa visée générale, cet article se propose d'explorer le travail d'écriture de l'histoire en temps de guerre, ou plutôt la posture que les historiens adoptent vis-à-vis de la guerre, à la fois celle qu'ils étudient a posteriori et celle qu'ils vivent dans le moment du présent. En jetant l'éclairage sur le parcours et l'œuvre de certains historiens de l'ère républicaine en Chine (1912-1949), un moment de l'histoire chinoise dont le conflit sino-japonais (1937-1945) nous rappelle combien il fut violent, nous tentons d'examiner la manière dont la guerre infléchit la pratique historienne et les possibles mises en récit de l'expérience humaine qui lui sont sous-jacentes. Dans un regard inverse, il s'agit aussi de voir comment, dans le déploiement de la guerre, l'histoire peut, à sa manière, être enrôlée comme instrument de mobilisation sociale, comme récit de positionnement individuel et collectif, ou encore comme outil de légitimation de l'action politique dans le présent. The aim of this article is to explore the writing of history in times of war; or rather, the positions adopted by historians concerning war, be it studied after the events or experienced at the time of writing. By shedding light on the background and the work of some Chinese historians of the republican era (1912-1949), a period of particular violence in China, as the Sino-Japanese conflict (1937-1945) reminds us, we examine in this paper the different ways in which war affects historical research, and the narratives of human experience that may possibly underlie it. Conversely, we also try to observe how, as war spreads, history itself may be "enlisted" by historians as an instrument for social mobilization, a narrative for individual and collective self-positioning, and a tool to legitimize political action in the present. 本文整體的主旨在於探討戰爭時期的歷史書寫，或者更確切地說，史學家面對戰爭 的姿態，其中不僅涉及他們對過去戰爭所做的歷史研究，也包涵他們在當下所經歷 的戰爭。正如一糸列中日衝突（1937-1945)所顯示，有鑒於民國時期（1912-1949)的中 國戰火頻仍，本文藉由對幾位此時期中國史學家之背景及著作的研究，試圖檢視戰 爭如何以多元的方式影響著史學活~<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo analiza la forma de comprensión de los casos de aprobación y rechazo de acuerdos reparatorios en materias de violencia doméstica, cuando tanto la víctima como el imputado pertenecen al pueblo mapuche, que han sido resueltos desde el año 2011 por tribunales de la Región de La Araucanía. Se plantea que las formas de comprender estos casos por los tribunales y la doctrina no ha sido la correcta, por cuanto se han centrado en determinar la primacía exclusiva que tendría uno de los derechos en disputa por sobre el otro. Frente a ello, el artículo sugiere que la forma adecuada de entender estos conflictos multiculturales, y a la decisión judicial que se pronuncia sobre los mismos, es reconociendo el elemento "trágico" que se encuentra presente, y que se configura a partir de un reconocimiento de las características e importancia de los principios en colisión y de los bienes jurídicos que protegen. This paper analyzes the way of understanding the cases of approval and rejection of compensation agreements in matters of domestic violence, where both the victim and the accused belong to the Mapuche people, which have been resolved since 2011 by courts of the Araucanía Region. It argues that the ways of understanding these cases by the courts and the doctrine has not been proper, since ithas focused on determine the exclusive primacy that one of the colliding rights would have over the other. Facing this issue, the article suggests that the best way to understand these multicultural conflicts, and the judicial decision pronounced on them, is considering the "tragic" element present in these cases, which is configured from the recognition of the characteristics and importance of the principles in collision and the legal goods they protect.<br>

Abstract: Ibn Warraq has recently compiled two books, one on Muḥammad, the other on the Qurʾān. His stated aim is to show that "Muslims need new scientific research into the Qurʾān, and a reexamination of the Qurʾānic message and its meaning in the 21st century" (Ibn Warraq, 2002, p. 59). But his massive anthologizing of old material is remarkable only for its copious display of a humanistic thinking, and the unquestioned commitment to the totalizing rationalism of modern enlightenment. While the hermeneutical approach of this essay explores possible ways of appropriating postmodern strategies for the purpose of understanding the Qurʾān, it also underscores the violence in Ibn Warraq's proposed literary criticism, and its roots in the metaphysics of the letter, and the cultic attachment to the graph.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: Le berger est traditionnellement lié au religieux, et l'on a pu dire, dans ce sens, qu'il est "réparateur de continuité" (Christian Morzewski). Cette continuité se manifeste, entre autres, par un savoir astral. "Les Bergers" et Désert de Le Clézio reprennent manifestement ce topos mythique, mais en présentent en même temps une version "brisée": le ciel étoilé n'offre guère de stabilité, mais se fragmente et se fait miroir de la violence des hommes. Par ailleurs, au berger se substituent les figures de l'artisan-pêcheur (Naman) et du gitan-voleur (Radics), qu'on peut lire comme des doubles affaiblis, voire dégradés. Chez Dhôtel, le berger est d'emblée un personnage marginalisé, coupé de tout savoir mythique, et réduit à constater des coïncidences, des incidents. Aussi se caractérise-t-il par sa légèreté, son jeu. Le Clézio et Dhôtel semblent ainsi explorer deux poétiques contrastées du mythe, nostalgique et ludique. Le Clézio —proche en cela d'un Claude Lévi-Strauss — voit/écrit le mythe comme un grand récit perdu, alors que Dhôtel semble plus proche de la mètis grecque, de l'"intelligence souple" qui relève du "savoir-faire de l'artisan," voire de la duplicité du trickster.<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, l'on analyse quelques facettes de l'état de stress post-traumatique consécutif à la violence de masse survenue au Rwanda dans les bribes de la mémoire confuse des jeunes personnages de L'Aîné des orphelins de Tierno Monénembo. D'une part, l'on examine la manière dont les discours sur les massacres produits par les jeunes personnages achèvent un degré de fiabilité, malgré les handicaps de la mémoire figée par le trauma. D'autre part, l'on voudrait savoir si la lecture d'une fiction littéraire écrite en état de stress post-traumatique peut inciter à terme à la mise sur pied d'une nouvelle société, porteuse de germes de promesse de bonheur et de reconstruction des mentalités.<br>

Abstract: El dominio de una memoria generalizada crea un conflicto entre memoria e historia. La modesta memoria de la historia oral tiene que convivir con una orgullosa memoria oficial que toma el lugar de la historia. Esta memoria se convierte en un obstáculo para los testimonios. El conflicto se puede superar si esas dos vías de aproximación al pasado reconocen sus limitaciones comunes: Ambas son una visión parcial del pasado. Esto es una obligación porque sus complementariedades son necesarias para el estudio de la violencia extrema del siglo XX. The domination of generalised memory creates a conflict between memory and history. The modest memory of oral history has to live with a proud and official memory which takes the place of history. This memory becomes an obstacle to witnesses' testimonials. The conflict can be overcome if these two ways of approaching the past acknowledge their common limitations: both of them are a partial vision of the past. This is compulsory because their complementarities are necessary to study XX century extreme violence.<br>

Abstract: Cet entretien, réalisé à l'occasion de la parution du dernier ouvrage d'Arno J. Mayer, Les Furies, permet de retracer l'itinéraire intellectuel de cet historien du contemporain nourri de science politique et d'un marxisme hétérodoxe. Il met en lumière tout l'intérêt des méthodes et des questionnements d'un chercheur soucieux de penser de manière comparée les moments de crise sociale et politique en Europe et d'en comprendre la violence. Les prises de position politiques d'A. J. Mayer éclairent son œuvre et dessinent les difficultés et les originalités d'un parcours engagé dans l'université américaine depuis la fin des années 1950. This interview, conducted on the occasion of the publication of Arno J. Mayer's latest book, Les Furies, recounts the intellectual itinerary of this historian of the contemporary period, nurtured by political science and unorthodox Marxism. It brings out the interesting aspects of the methods and questioning used by this researcher who studies moments of social and political crisis in Europe comparatively and aims at understanding their violence. The political positions taken by A. J. Mayer help explain his writings and indicate the problems and originality of the path taken by a committed scholar who has been working in American universities since the end of the 1950s.<br>

1997, nueva edición corregida, y al de Marie-Claire Lavabre, "Usages et mésusages de la notion
de mémoire", Critique Internationale, núm. 7, abril de 2000, pp. 48-57. El psiquiatra René Kaës
hace hincapié en que el "borrar los asesinatos colectivos y la violencia estatal mina la generación
de bases narcisistas; toma las riendas para destruirlo todo, la memoria y la transmisión. Lo que
se borra, como si no hubiera ocurrido, no tiene donde inscribirse para ser pensado ni para rela-
cionar la lección de las historias individuales con la historia colectiva. René Kaës, Violence d'Etat
et psychanalyse, París, Dunod, 1989, p. XV.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se abordan algunas de las cuestiones metodológicas que plantea el análisis de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres en la historia, como contrapunto a la existencia de este tipo de violencia en nuestra sociedad. En primer lugar se exponen las diferentes fórmulas que se utilizan para nombrarla —«violencia de género», «violencia sexista», «violencia sexual», «violencia doméstica o familiar», «violencia de pareja», «violencia machista»...—, sus significados y connotaciones políticas, y su validez conceptual para la investigación histórica; a continuación se tratan algunos de los problemas que surgen al estudiar la violencia contra las mujeres a partir de las fuentes documentales históricas, y, finalmente, se analiza cómo puede repercutir en el presente el análisis histórico de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres. This essay considers some of the methodological issues raised by the analysis of male violence against women in the past, as a counterpoint to the persistence of this kind of violence in our society. In the first place, the author examines the different expressions used to name this kind of violence —«gender violence», «sexist violence»,«sexual violence», «domestic violence or violence in the family», «partner violence in couples», «macho violence»...—,their meaning and political connotations. Some of the problems posed by the study of violence against women based on historical documentary sources are considered thereafter, to finish analyzing the possible effects on the present situation of an historical analysis of male violence against women.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Daniel<br>
Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Abstract: Girard, the sacred consists of:
all those forces whose dominance over man increases or seems to increase in pro-
portion to man's effort to master them. Tempests, forest fires, and plagues, among
other phenomena, may be classified as sacred. Far outranking these, however,
though in a far less obvious manner, stands human violence - violence seen as
something exterior to man and henceforth as a part of all the other outside forces
that threaten mankind. Violence is the heart and secret soul of the sacred. (31)<br>

Article Title: The Ontology of "Political Violence": Action and Identity in Civil Wars<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i288399<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Zur Stathis N.<br>
Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: En analysant l'épisode de la lettre à Johnson publiée en avril 1966 par "Témoignage chrétien" et "Cité nouvelle," Sabine Rousseau décrit les mécanismes d'une mobilisation, alors pionnière, contre la guerre du Vietnam. Au lendemain de Vatican II, l'enracinement chrétien confère à cet engagement une forme originale, caractéristique d'un tiers-mondisme fondé moins sur les théories de l'impérialisme que sur le sentiment de la responsabilité chrétienne dans le drame vietnamien. /// The publication in "Cité nouvelle" and "Témoignage chrétien," on 21 April 1966, of an appeal to President Johnson marked the French Protestant and Catholic left's entry in the fight against the Vietnam war. Although somewhat late in their mobilization with respect to the Peace Movement, the commitment was early enough considering the dominant silence outside communist and communist sympathizer circles. As a sequel to the struggle for decolonization, this commitment took the original form of a letter to the president of the US. The feeling of Christian responsibility for the history of imperialism overtook the political analysis of the war. After a difficult beginning, the public opinion campaign grew during the summer, favored by the escalation of violence in Vietnam. But to the most committed left Christian militants, the campaign seemed already insufficient. Their radicalization in the fall of 1966 prepared for a mobilization in which the specific Christian commitment gave way to common action with the anti-imperialist movements.<br>

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Author(s): Zimra Michael F.<br>
Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i40028027<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Armstrong Andrew H.<br>
Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: Um dos maiores riscos que ameaçam as nossas sociedades contemporâneas é a «etnicização» das relações sociais. Este artigo examina, a partir do caso francês, o papel da escola no agravamento dos processos de segregação étnica e da banalização da violência. Dando conta do logro do modelo republicano, este artigo tenta desenhar os contornos de uma escola da modernidade, apta a assumir uma missão política e moral: a de formar os cidadãos de um mundo pluralista. Un des risques majeurs qui menacent nos sociétés contemporaines est celui de l'ethnicisation des rapports sociaux. Cet article examine, à partir du cas français, le rôle de l'école dans l'aggravation des processus de ségrégation ethnique et d'essentialisation de la violence. Il prend acte de l'échec du modèle républicain et tente de dessiner les contours d'une école de la modernité, apte à assumer une mission politique et morale, celle de former les citoyens d'un monde pluraliste. One of the greatest risks facing modern society is the «ethnicization» of social relations. This article uses the French example to examine the role of school in aggravating ethnic segregation and making violence an everyday affair. In giving an account of the failure of the republican model, this article seeks to provide an outline of a school for modernity, fit to take on a political and moral assignment: that of educating the citizens of a pluralist world.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40059165<br>
Date: 11 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Larkin Craig<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Article Title: PEACEFUL MEMORIES: REMEMBERING AND FORGETTING POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN KANGWANE, SOUTH AFRICA<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40072402<br>
Date: 8 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Ally Shireen<br>
Abstract: Despite its manifest, if largely undocumented, histories of menacing violence and perilous politics, the thrust of popular memory in the former apartheid bantustan of KaNgwane insists that it was a peaceful, even apolitical, place. In a contemporary South African memorial culture that idealizes memories of victimization by (and resistance to) apartheid and its political violence, why would some in KaNgwane persistently narrate the past through tropes of peaceful order and disavowals of the political? Are these mnemonic effacements in KaNgwane best conceived of as forms of forgetting? This article challenges such a proposition. First, it recovers the hitherto unrecognized politics and violence in KaNgwane, in part (and paradoxically) out of the very same narratives that deny such histories. Second, it explores the dialectical co-implication of remembering and forgetting, and of memory and history, in KaNgwane's supposed anamnesis. And third, it proposes that the occlusions and assurances of memory in KaNgwane are structured by a localized semiotics in which politics is retrospectively signified by order and restraint, and negated by disorder and revolt. In this ' memory work', KaNgwane's past is anaesthetized of violence, and heroism is recovered not from rehearsals of victimization and resistance, but from memories of pacified civility instead. Malgré son passé manifeste (bien que non documenté pour l'essentiel) de violence menaçante et de politique périlleuse, la mémoire populaire de l'ancien bantoustan de KaNgwane sous le régime de l'apartheid insiste, dans ses grandes lignes, sur le caractère paisible et apolitique du lieu. Dans une culture de mémoire sud-africaine contemporaine qui idéalise les mémoires de victimisation par (et de résistance à) l'apartheid et sa violence politique, pourquoi certains à KaNgwane persistent-ils à narrer le passé à travers des tropes d'ordre paisible et de désaveu du politique? Faut-il concevoir ces effacements mnémoniques au KaNgwa~<br>

Abstract: The 2001 disarmament of kamajor combatants in Bo, Sierra Leone was an event marked by violence. This paper considers that violence, and by extension other violent events in Sierra Leone's recent war, as narrative blocs: configurations of agency, time, imagery and articulation. This formulation stands in contrast to the way vionent events are often treated, as exceptional moments of outburst or eruption resulting from abnormal circumstances but meaningless in themselves. The paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork with the kamajor militia movement in Sierra Leone to trace some of these blocs both within the disarmament center and through other locations in the "war-scape" of Sierra Leone.<br>

Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Abstract: Fazendo emergir elementos susceptíveis de desconstruir o filme Vertigo de Alfred Hitchcock e, assim, operar uma hermenêutica do testemunho, procuraremos demonstrar como a metafísica do "tempo do projecto" e a atitude filosófica do "catastrofismo esclarecido" propostas por Jean-Pierre Dupuy, integram-se e sustentam-se na lógica do testemunho. Este trabalho apresenta-se como um triplo pretexto: num primeiro momento, a insustentabilidade do niilismo uma vez que, se o desejo mimético pode ser "niilizante", ele também é condição da possibilidade do luto e, portanto, de (re-)criação e do testemunho; num segundo momento, o de mostrar a compatibilidade da desconstrução de Jacques Derrida com a hermenêutica do testemunho esboçada por Paul Ricœur, podendo ser a primeira o momento da conversão impulsionador da (re-)criação do sentido, necessário à concretização da segunda; num terceiro momento, o de considerarmos a hipótese do tempo do projecto e do testemunho, enquanto excedente do tempo da catástrofe e do niilismo, serem uma brecha para entrevermos o recuo, o adiar, a economia do desvio diferencial da crueldade humana e da violência. Making emerge elements that can help us deconstruct the film Vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock and, therefore, operate a hermeneutic of testimony, we will try to demonstrate how the metaphysics of the "Time of Project" and the philosophical attitude of the "enlightened catastrophism" proposed by Jean-Pierre Dupuy can be integrated and sustained in the logic of testimony. This work presents itself as a triple pretext: in a first moment, the unsustainability of the nihilism, once that, if the mimetic desire may be "nihilist", it is also a condition for the possibility of mourning and, therefore, for the possibility of (re-)creation and testimony; in a second moment, to show the compatibility of deconstruction of Jacques Derrida with the hermeneutics of testimony outlined by Paul Ricœur, being the first probably the moment of the catalyst conversion of (~<br>

Date: 4 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Liebsch Burkhard<br>
Abstract: This paper raises the question whether language and violence are internally connected. It starts from the experience of violence and from its theoretical interpretation as violence in the context of political forms of life which are challenged by complaints about violence. Such forms of life have to confront this issue because they are supposed to be responsive to claims and demands of others who articulate violence as an experience of violation. Whether a kind of responsive ethos may be based on the suspected inner connection between language and violence is being discussed at the end.<br>

Author(s): Jones Ricky L.<br>
Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to foster the regeneration and reorientation of peace research in the United States through its internationalization and radicalization. The authors locate the possible sources of this 'post-modern' redirection of American peace studies in the traditions of critical theory and phenomenology and in convergent work by contemporary West European scholars in Scandinavia and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main lines of this reorientation for American peace research are limned through an exploration of three substantive themes: power, violence, and hegemony; international society as totality; and the critical peace researcher as knower and actor.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110325<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110418<br>
Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): ANDERSSON KJERSTIN<br>
Abstract: In this article, a young man's narratives of violence are analysed, and a culturally shared storyline is identified as the basis of these narratives. It is argued that the stories are organized so as to construct a preferred self-presentation. One strategy to achieve this is to establish boundaries for what type of violence to use, whom to fight, where and for what reasons. I also argue that the narratives are structured to avoid being categorized as either victim or perpetrator, although both categories are drawn upon. Issues of masculinity are made relevant through categorization of the characters in the narrative, and positions are made available. Different masculine categories such as the hero/villain/non-man become relevant in the analysis. Different gendered positions are used in negotiating a masculine identity around narratives of and through telling about violence.<br>

Abstract: Son opposition à l'indépendance de l'Algérie est le seul grief aujourd'hui avancé contre un auteur devenu une icône. Camus a condamné le FLN parce qu'il pratiquait le terrorisme contre les civils et voulait par la violence monopoliser la représentation du peuple algérien. Il est resté jusqu'à la fin favorable à des réformes économiques et sociales radicales. Son Algérie plurielle, égalitaire et française, était une utopie condamnée. Le Premier Homme, un roman, lui a permis, à la fin de sa vie, de corriger les analyses de ses articles.<br>

Abstract: La phénoménologie de Husserl est tenue pour descriptive dans la mesure où elle montre comment les choses apparaissent. Cela commence avec la visée de toute chose comme quelque chose. Voir et « voir comme », montrer et dire, sont profondément entrelacés. Toutefois, la description indirecte va plus loin. Elle se réfère à quelque chose en renvoyant à quelque chose d'autre – nous le savons depuis le concept de communication indirecte de Kierkegaard et l'analyse bakhtinienne de la parole indirecte et de la citation. Une approche indirecte est requise aussitôt que notre expérience dépasse le royaume du sens et de l'intentionnalité, car nous sommes alors confrontés à quelque chose qui nous affecte et à quoi nous répondons. Les principales figures de l'indirectivité vont au-delà du sens sous la forme de l'excès, de la déviance, ou du retrait. La voie de la description indirecte sera illustrée en référence à quelques phénomènes cruciaux: la dimension passive de l'attention, le caractère responsif de la liberté, le fait de porter témoignage de la violence, et la scission entre le dire et le dit. Husserl's phenomenology turns out to be descriptive as far as it shows how things appear. It starts with taking everything as something. Seeing and seeing as, showing and saying are deeply interconnected. But indirect description goes further. It refers to something by referring to something else, as we know it from Kierkegaard's concept of indirect communication or from Bakhtin's analysis of indirect speech and of quotation. An indirect approach is required as soon as our experience surpasses the realm of meaning and intentionality, being confronted with something we are affected by and with something we respond to. Main figures of indirectness are going beyond by excess, deviating from, or withdrawing from. The way of indirect description will be illustrated by referring to some crucial phenomena: the passive part of attention, the responsive character of liberty, bearing witness of~<br>

Abstract: Esta é uma pesquisa intervençāo na quai foram usadas oficinas de narrativas de histórias como dispositivo para estimular empoderamento de mulheres. Essas oficinas, que contaram com a participaçāo de dez mulheres em situaçāo de violência de gênero, foram realizadas na sede da organizaçāo nāo-governamental Maria Mulher, situada na Vila Cruzeiro do Sul, no municipio de Porto Alegre. A partir de oficinas de narrativas de histórias em que se tematizaram historias do feminine especialmente afro-brasileiras, a pesquisa teve como objetivo principal compreender o que acontece com as mulheres que sofreram ou sofrem violência. Realizadas em cinco encontros nos quais as mulheres contaram e ouviram histórias e participaram de vivências, as oficinas oportunizaram espaço para narrar, ouvir e ritualizar as histórias das orixás e ressignificar as vidas a partir dessas vivências. Essa intervençāo operou com as subjetividades das mulheres que fizeram parte da pesquisa e mostrou-se capaz de fortalecer algumas delas. A experiência constituiu um dispositivo de estímulo ao empoderamento das mulheres e contribuiu para resgate da memòria individual e coletiva desse grupo. This study consists of an intervention using narrative workshops as a device to stimulate the empowerment of women. Ten women, victims of gender violence, took part in a workshop developed by non-governmental organization for African-Brazilian women Maria Mulher, which gives assistance to women living in Vila Cruzeiro do Sul, in the city of Porto Alegre. The main objective of the research was to debate questions related to gender and violence, making use of stories and histories related to the feminine, specifically African-Brazilian stories. Five meetings were held, where the women told and were told stories, took part in group discussions, experiences and rituals. The workshops gave those women a space where they could tell and hear stories, take part in the rituals of the orixás [African-Brazilian deities] of the black ~<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i397690<br>
Date: 3 21, 1976<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: Our political imaginations and the international arena are preoccupied with the inevitability of a clash of civilisations. While it is true that cultural and religious differences have precipitated violence, we have also witnessed a real dialogue of cultures. If conflicting economic interests and political concerns are taken to mean irreconcilable religious world views, ethnic cleansing and genocide will become the norm. We need a dialogue of culture as a prelude to a dialogue of religions, thus freeing us from the distrust of the Other.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178171<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: À Santiago deux femmes s'affrontent. La procédure du délit d'injures nécessite, dans cette société orale de la première moitié du XVIIIe siècle, l'exposé de questions sensibles qui concernent, dans ce cas particulier, les identités féminines. Croisées par de multiples variables, dont l'ethnie est l'une des plus importantes, ces identités de femmes s'expriment dans des lieux sociaux plus ou moins contestés: la fragilité de ces identités s'observe dans l'expression de la violence privée et dans les discours juridiques. Réfléchir sur la manière d'appréhender et de vivre les possibilités d'être femme dans une des villes de l'Amérique hispanique est un des objectifs de cette analyse. L'autre, montre comment les discours sur le métissage et les valeurs qu'ils portent s'incarnent dans les sujets au niveau des conflits mineurs, quotidiens, jusqu'à faire basculer, à travers la parole et l'opinion sur autrui, des parcours individuels. Verbal confrontations between women in early 18th century Santiago brought women into the courtroom where juridical procedures concerning slander raised issues about feminine identity. A variety of factors shaped these identities, including most notably ethnicity. In contested social locations, women were often the object of interpersonal violence and juridical discourse. This article considers the varieties of women's experiences and how these shaped their identities in a Spanish American city of the period. It also examines the discourses about miscegenation and how they became embodied on the subjects engaged in acts of minor daily conflicts; the words and judgments of others at times had dramatic consequences on individual lives.<br>

Abstract: Les analyses de Hannah Arendt et de Alain Finkielkraut démontrent clairement la nécessité et l'urgence d'une réflexion sur la signification politique de la pensée. L'humanité cesse d'être humaine dès lors qu'il n'y a plus de place pour la figure de l'ennemi : elle est multiple et pluriellement pensante. Ainsi la discorde est-elle le bien politique le plus précieux. Alors que la fraternité sentimentale et manichéenne masque le totalitarisme et la violence, la solidarité, elle, fait signe vers l'unité à travers le multiple : elle constitue un espace à plusieurs voix. Le Christ n'a-t-il pas demandé l'amour des ennemis? The analyses made by Hannah Arendt and Alain Finkielkraut show clearly the necessity, and indeed the urgency, of reflecting on the political significance of one's personal morality. Humanity ceases to be human when it decrees that there is no longer any room in the world for whomever may be its enemy; a body of persons tends to think collectively in this way. Thus it turns out that of all political stock-in-trade, discord becomes the most precious item. Good-versus-evil brainwashing, and calls for brotherhood on one's own side of a conflict, are used to mask totalitarianism and violence, but universal solidarity includes everyone and implies universal concord. Did Christ not entreat us to love our enemies?<br>

Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Other poets use endnotes to make visible the constraints that structure their poems, in a mode reminiscent of the Oulipian penchant for texts that thematize or otherwise lay bear their constraints. In four of the poems in
         Lighthead, African American poet Terrance Hayes borrows the form of thepecha kucha, a Japanese business presentation in which “a presenter narrates or riffs on twenty images connected to a single theme for twenty seconds at a time.”
               Hayes directs the reader out of his book and across media to a website (88
            http://www.pechakucha.org/) for more information on the form; and he suggests Googling images of works by African American sculptor Martin Puryear that correspond to “Arbor for Butch.” “Coffin for Head of State” is written “after” the songs of Nigerian musician and composer Fela Kuti; and “Twenty Measures of Chitchat” draws on “conversational fragments.” In one section of “Twenty Measures,” titled “Landscape with Riot,” looting and cannibalism are described as modes of appropriation: “When the house windows were broken, I was one of the people / stepping in, then out again, with boxes and whole registers / of what belonged to me, with dream-swollen jewelry leashed / about my neck, with blood on my shirt and blood on my teeth.”
               The image of the speaker with bloodied teeth, appropriating commodities, appears amended in the following section (“The Imminent Till”) by the statement “Time is the real cannibal.” It is the violence of American racism that is cannibalistic in this portrayal. The title refers to Emmett Till, the fourteen-year-old African American boy from Chicago who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a white woman:89
            
               Till's body was found in the Tallahatchie River, with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. His death helped spark the civil rights movement. It inspired dozens of poems (from Langston Hughes to Marilyn ~<br>

Abstract: If Dekuah signifies the unwillingness to live, or reminds us of the Frankenstein syndrome, as suggested above, it is no surprise that the child in the poem immediately announces that he is not Dekuah; he has not come to die. Emphasizing the singularity of his existence, his will to live, he says, “I've never been born before,” and then goes on to announce what he is and what he desires. “My name is Nehklon / Let me live.” Of particular relevance is the shift from the negative declaration “I am not” to a positive one, “I am.” In this linguistic switch, the poet signals a deeper moral and existential consequence. In this shift from a reactionary attitude to life to one that is proactive, Jabbeh Wesley brings the challenges of life affirmation to the consciousness of her readers. Through Nehklon, she enables us to imagine people taking charge of their lives, as Primo Levi does in his “If This Is a Man.” It is therefore not only Nehklon who pleads; all Liberians plead for a chance to live, for a fair share in life's bounty. There is nothing to be happy about in the remembrance of the war's violence; there is no happy ending for the narrative other than the hope that people might be allowed to live and to thrive. People are not Dekuahs; they have not come to die.<br>

Abstract: Psychoanalysis gives us a way of addressing the tension between ethics and politics that springs the trap of this double bind. The pledge of psychoanalysis is to critically examine how we project our unconscious fears and desires onto others whom we call foreigners, enemies, monsters, deserving some form of death penalty. It commands us to investigate how we distribute dignity, equality, and respect such that some profit while others pay the price. The psychoanalytic supplement binds ethics to politics without appeals to the soveriegnty of the will or of God but, rather, through the interminable process of analyzing the ways in which we disavow and avow our investments in violence and cruelty.<br>

Abstract: In that year three states did not allow women to serve on juries, and the idea of women CEOs of large corporations seemed absurd in the popular imagination. In that imagination the proper place for them was in the home as wives and mothers, hospitals as nurses, primary and secondary schools as teachers, or libraries. The minimum wage increased by fifteen cents to $1.15 an hour. Algeria, Kenya, Angola, and many other countries were colonies, although major anticolonial movements took place around the world as Western colonial power crumbled. In May of that year the Freedom Rides and the extreme violence that went with them took place in the deep South and worked a largely unexpected revolution for interstate public transportation and for the standing and influence of the civil rights movement. Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Homes entered the University of Georgia under heavy guard and brought the beginning of the end to segregation in that university. “Acid rain” first became a recognized concept in this country in 1961.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In a somewhat Nietzschean line of reasoning, the excess of the exaggerated falsehood, the hyperbolic lie, is the lie in/of the “truth,” which forces one into the violence of errant subjective (re)interpretation, the truth(s) in/of the lie. Hyperbole's figural expression exceeds the literal thing expressed, thereby marking the literal (in excess) as figure, and this errancy produces real, contextual change, for example, as “hyperbolic praxis” (Webb
         1993a), by dramatically moving toward a psychological and/or phenomenological transition. The errant formation reveals the instability at the center of what is attempting to be expressed. As Suzanne Guerlac (1990) suggests, hyperbole throws beyond the signified but also renders the signified a signifier, which signifies excess itself. It heightens the literal, exaggerates it, and throws beyond it in order to reveal its errancy and show its figurative nature, thereby allowing for a disruptive hermeneutical mode of thought that offers a transition from one way of perceiving the world to another.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: In addition, Ricoeur believes that a purely deontological framework like Kant's is insufficiently sensitive to the asymmetry inherent in human action. Humans not only do evil, they also suffer evil at the hands of others, and disproportionately so when they are the innocent victims of ignominious power. Much to our regret, the powerful few can bring whole peoples and nations to their knees, or very nearly annihilate them altogether, if they are fanatics and lack restraint. Precisely because others may be the non-consenting recipients of our actions, Ricoeur argues, we ought to treat them with the same solicitude we treat ourselves. And we should do so graciously, he adds, not with the expectation of receiving something of equal or greater value in return, but out of a sense of gratitude for the plenitude that has been given us. Hence, for Ricoeur, the primary concern of ethics is less about honoring rigid rules and more about taking responsibility for the welfare of others. Under the aegis of the good, decency obliges us first and foremost to minimize violence against the person, in all it nefarious forms, so that we can then maximize human flourishing across the globe—all of which brings Ricoeur well within the orbit of Shaw, who shares the same priorities and whose ethics is similarly teleological.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: So many twentieth-century rhetorical theories can be said to have utopian aims that just a list may be enough to persuade utopian studies scholars of the theoretical and interpretive potential available to them in this thriving discipline. Any rhetorical theorist who claims that rhetoric may be the answer to avoiding physical violence or war, or that it may be the cure for ills in society that result from ideological differences, has utopian ideas about rhetoric's function. The theories of Chaim Perelman, Richard Weaver, Stephen Toulmin, Mikhail Bakhtin, Wayne Booth, Stanley Fish, and others all seem to fit into this model to a greater or lesser degree. Twentieth-century theories of rhetoric often arose from historical circumstances involving war and what the theorists saw as the abuse of rhetoric, so understanding social processes and substituting a “good rhetoric” in order to build a better society is something they see as an antidote. Rhetoric, like utopia, is inherently an ethical concern from this point of view. The fact that several of these rhetoricians have been influenced by the Marxist utopists I just discussed is evidence of cross-pollination in the two contemporary fields—or perhaps more accurately, the lack of distinct differences between them at all. Like all areas that seem to be lumped under “cultural studies,” there is so much borrowing and generalizing that it is a struggle to speak of distinct disciplines. Nevertheless, there are creative and interpretive benefits to the mix, including a wealth of terminologies from which to choose.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Coming from the Latin
         decidere, “to cut off,” “by giving the victory to one side or the other” in a choice or conflict,decidecan have no truck with “both/and.” In point of fact, ethical behavior requires that the ambivalence of extreme relativism and radical subjectivity be overcome so that something like provisional certainty can arise, such as utopian imagination requires and projects. It does not matter that such certainty may be short-lived. The value of Utopia for imagining superior conditions resides in its vocation for doing so, even if time and necessity must always defeat attempts at total application: life lived will always attempt to play itself out in the loosest conformity with the prescriptions of any plan or social project (even in the face of violence).<br>
