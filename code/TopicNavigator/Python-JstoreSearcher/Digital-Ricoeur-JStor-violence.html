  Book Title: Mimetic Theory and World Religions-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schenk Richard<br>
  Abstract: Those who anticipated the demise of religion and the advent of a peaceful, secularized global village have seen the last two decades confound their predictions. René Girard's mimetic theory is a key to understanding the new challenges posed by our world of resurgent violence and pluralistic cultures and traditions. Girard sought to explain how the Judeo-Christian narrative exposes a founding murder at the origin of human civilization and demystifies the bloody sacrifices of archaic religions. Meanwhile, his book
      Sacrifice, a reading of conflict and sacrificial resolution in the Vedic Brahmanas, suggests that mimetic theory's insights also resonate with several non-Western religious and spiritual traditions. This volume collects engagements with Girard by scholars of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism and situates them within contemporary theology, philosophy, and religious studies.<br>

  Author(s) Ericksen Adam<br>
  Abstract: In the epilogue of his book
                  Battling to the EndRené Girard articulates his growing anxiety concerning the West and Islam since September 11, 2001. He states that “We are witnessing a new stage in the escalation to extremes.”¹ Asan escalation of mimetic rivalry, both Islam and the West are responsible for their participation in the current global crisis of violence. Indeed, Girard claims in the same book, “When violence is involved, wrongs are always shared.”² But it might seem as though violence is endemic to Islam in a way that it is not to the West. Girard invokes Islamic<br>

  Abstract: I have to apologize—being not a Girardian—when starting with an idea introduced in the text on “Violence and Religion: Cause or Effect?”: “The question of religious violence is first and foremost a human question, . . . and not a directly religious question” (Girard 2004).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: Girard’s reflections have led us to recognize sacred violence as the foundation of Western culture. Sacred violence, in turn, has its roots in mimetic conflicts: the rivals are brothers who are both brought closer and divided by something they both desire. I have also argued that mimetic rivalry is the engine that drives all intellectual symbolism. Thus, the “figure” that represents that symbolism better than any other is that of enemy brothers, who are brothers precisely because they are enemies (or made alike by their reciprocal violent rivalry) and enemies precisely because they are brothers (or rivals inasmuch as each<br>

  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

  PRELUDE. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: Siblings play a critical role in mimetic rivalries that characterize the family romance. As a consequence, our relations with siblings anticipate, for better or worse, later adult relationships. As we grow and our world expands beyond the immediate family to encompass other relationships, we may remain caught in rivalries that have characterized our initial relationship with our siblings. Or, diverging from that scenario, we may experience with our siblings and with others a supportive intimacy that enables us to overcome the effects of trauma and violence in our lives.<br>

  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Abstract: In 1936 General Francisco Franco and other military leaders revolted against the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, plunging the country into a devastating civil war that would last until 1939. American Roman Catholics faced divided loyalties in trying to stake out positions in the public discourse about the war. Hoping that the Republic would become more democratic, and fearful of Francoʹs ʺcrusade,ʺ some Catholics argued for supporting the new Republican government even in the face of its violence against clerics of the state church. Other Catholics believed that Francoʹs campaign enjoyed clerical support and might, in spite<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

  Abstract: I first came across René Girard’s work in 1975. The director of the influential journal Esprit, Jean-Marie Domenach, urged me that year to read
                  La violence et le sacré.¹ That book represented in his opinion a major breakthrough in the social sciences, and Esprit was playing a major role in publicizing it. I read it reluctantly, as I was at the time still under the spell of the thinking of Ivan Illich, a major social critic with whom I had just collaborated in the writing of his bookMedical Nemesis.² I was impressed but not especially moved by my reading<br>

  Abstract: In my early twenties, I joined a Byzantine Catholic commune in the south of France, La Communauté de la Théophanie. It was at the crossroads of a number of influences, especially Gandhian nonviolence and the discovery and practice of Eastern Christianity, along with a third influence, the Charismatic Renewal, with its religious fervor and warm ecumenical impulse. Nonviolence was a whole program. It meant a simple, rural daily lifestyle tending toward economic self-sufficiency and a refusal to participate in any form of violence, direct or institutional, such as military service.

  Abstract: The groundwork for my encounter with the work of René Girard was laid early in my life. I grew up in a tumultuous era that sensitized me to violence. Trips with my parents through the U.S. South enabled me to observe the persistence of Jim Crow in “colored” and “white” schools. Even as a child, I saw and felt that race-based disparities in educational opportunity constituted a reprehensible act of violence. The Vietnam War shaped my experience in high school and college. Especially in college, I brought the resources of my liberal education to bear upon the violence around me.<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Abstract: In 1758 English troops stormed Senegal, seizing property valued at more than £250,000. According to Peter Linebaugh, one of the seamen who fought for the Crown in the battle, John Ward, was soon thereafter “hanged [in London] for stealing a watch.” Linebaugh thus shows how empires plunder and pillage with impunity while working stiffs, including those trained in the ways of violence by the Crown, are hanged for committing the most trifling crimes. Ward would appear to have been particularly unlucky, for Eric Williams observes that “in 1745 transportation [the euphemism for banishing convicts] was the penalty for the theft<br>

                  The Anarchiadas a coming age of democracy run wild. Part of this backlash against those who took the words of the Declaration of Independence too literally—for of course all men were not created equal and happiness was not a natural right—entailed the use of state-sanctioned violence,<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: This book is an extended conversation about contemporary forms of human experience and subjectivity. It examines the genealogy of what we consider to be the modern subject, and it inquires into the continuity and diversity of personhood across greatly diverse societies, including the ways in which inner processes are reshaped amid economic and political reforms, violence, and social suffering. It is an ethnographic conversation, with authors confronting specific forms of social life in particular settings, and it is a theoretical conversation, exploring the debates and disciplinary disagreements about how we think and write about human agency today.<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>

  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

  Abstract: To whom do the dead belong? And how must they be claimed? War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history. Religious tradition is subordinated or expropriated by state<br>

  Book Title: The Maternal Factor-Two Paths to Morality<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps the saddest evolutionary legacy still oppressing us is the male tendency toward aggression and violence. Many feminist thinkers have insisted that virtually all gender differences in temperament and behavior are products of culture and socialization, but evidence to the contrary has been accumulating. One need not be an essentialist to believe that many differences anchored in our evolutionary past are innate in the sense that they are heavily influenced by biology. When I reject essentialism, I reject the idea that female and male human beings were

The Berlin Wall had fallen in November 1989, but there was already a widespread feeling of frustration concerning the newly conjoined Germanies. Many in both east and west wondered aloud whether things might be better if the wall were still standing. In the former East Germany, and in Berlin in particular, violence against foreigners had increased; there had been murders, and tensions had increased to the point that the federal border police had been called in to provide security on the Berlin subways.

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

  1  Exegesis and Violence: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Renard John<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes famously observed in his
                  Leviathanthat human life is “nasty, brutish, and short.” He and other influential philosophers have identified violence as virtually a “state of nature” that humankind has struggled endlessly to ameliorate, and with precious little success. Religious authors in every age and culture have likewise filled libraries with their analyses of the roots and remedies of this scourge, this “mark of Cain.” Every credible religious or ethical system condemns murder, yet sacred texts claimed by adherents of most (if not all) religious traditions describe in often grisly detail how believers have had recourse to divinely<br>

  2  A Brief History of War in the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish Interpretive Tradition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Firestone Reuven<br>
  Abstract: The Hebrew Bible is a collection of diverse kinds of literature, reflecting many wide-ranging aspects of human culture and society, and spanning up to a thousand years of human experience.¹ Within this anthology one can find numerous stories depicting violence, battles, and all-out wars between individuals, families, tribes, and national communities. Some legal material also treats rules of behavior in war. These all reflect the social and political reality of the ancient Near East, where war and violent acts were considered to be normal, effective, and acceptable tools within the political repertoire available to family, tribal, and national leaderships.

  Abstract: Even though Jesus proclaimed a gospel of peace (Matthew 10:12–13; Luke 10:5; John 14:27; 20:19, 21, 26), Christians have repeatedly engaged in violent conflicts both with their neighbors in other religious traditions and with other Christians. Christian warriors have worn the sign of the cross in battle and have often seen themselves as fighting on behalf of God’s cause; they have cited biblical passages to justify violent assaults, inquisitions, and persecutions. Christians have also invoked the Bible to place limits on violence or to end violence altogether.<br>

  Abstract: In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith this came to be.

  Author(s) Choksy Jamsheed K.<br>
  Abstract: There are numerous past and present scholarly debates over interpretations of theological, ritual, and philological issues in the Zoroastrian Avesta, or scriptures, and its
                     Zand, or priestly commentaries. However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

Eight days later I traveled to the remote city of Nanded, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, for ethnographic research. At the Gandhi memorial, the Gita was regularly cited by tour guides and was even part of a makeshift display on the techniques of nonviolence that Gandhi used. The verses displayed were from the second half of the second chapter of the Gita, verses about attaining inner peace and self control, which Gandhi (d. 1948) felt were the core of the Gita’s message.

  Book Title: Rifle Reports-A Story of Indonesian Independence<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

  Abstract: News from afar sometimes seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to one’s own remembered past. This is not because of the banal redundancy of events but because of memory’s interpretive reach and its inclination to refurbish itself in contemporary designs and novel images. In 1994, when I was collecting these stories, horrifying pictures of ethnic violence from around the world seemed to appear nightly on the television news. In central Africa, roadways were filled with thousands of starving, desperate people traveling toward unknown destinations. This made a big impression on my Karo informants. “That’s exactly how it was here,” they<br>

  Author(s) Edwards Natalie<br>
  Abstract: Why would a writer publish a text that seemingly undoes the literary innovation of her life's work? Annie Ernaux has achieved fame by writing short, pithy narratives that recount isolated autobiographical moments. Rather than recounting events and extrapolating their meaning to her life within an autobiographical text, such as Michel de Montaigne falling off a horse, Jean-Jacques Rousseau stealing a ribbon, or André Gide travelling to North Africa, Ernaux chooses a specific incident — a love relationship, an abortion, a scene of domestic violence, for example — and describes this in sparse, unlyrical prose with no discussion of its consequences<br>

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

  6  Conclusions and Reflections from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878ws">Power and Politics in the Book of Judges</a><br>
  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary debates the most common charge made against religion—whether by those who seek to abolish or to renew religious faith—is that it tends to generate violence and intolerance.² While religious teachings often emphasize love and tolerance, it is easy enough to recite a litany of genocides, persecutions, and wars pursued in the name of one religion or another. For the new atheists, such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, this violent track record is the clearest example of how religion poisons everything and corrupts a humanity that otherwise would stand a better chance of being peaceful.

  Abstract: Prayer, both private and public, is one of the most common of human activities. All human history records it; its roots probably go back to before recorded history. Yet when we attempt to submit its most common form, that of petition, to philosophical analysis, we run into difficulties. All too often we pray for things, such as victory or gaining a desired position, and forget that there are losers in such competitions. Prayer, here, seems caught in the “mimetic violence” that René Girard describes. According to Girard, our socialization involves our imitating others. It thus leads us to desire what<br>

  Abstract: In the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to

Allegory is characterized by violence and is not at all beautiful, admittedly lacking “all ‘symbolic’ freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity” (166;Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels145). Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty. However, by discrediting the presumed authority of aesthetics (the beautiful) and idealism (the symbolic determination of the object as a reflection of the object<br>

  Abstract: Two objections arise repeatedly in connection with Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of language. First, it is argued, in the spirit of Jürgen Habermas and K. O. Apel, for whom ethics is grounded in discursive reason, that for Levinas ethics is an unmediated relation to the other and, as such, transcends linguistic and conceptual structure. Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence. Levinas’s access routes to the other are nonlinguistic: they include the human face, an idea of the infinite that exceeds any description of it, and<br>

  Author(s) de Wilde Marc<br>
  Abstract: Two months after the events of September 11, President George W.

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

So too would war be the theme of the first great poem of Western civilization.

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Abstract: In the 191Os, D. W. Griffith used Irish and Italian characters to touch the fears and address the needs of Anglo-American moviegoers: He probed nativist fears in scenes of ethnic violence, and he responded to Anglo needs with subtly distinctive Irish and Italian values. In the 1920s, a second stage commenced with the release of several hundred mainstream films featuring stereotypical ethnics and supposedly<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14jxtrg">Towards Commemoration: Ireland in war in revolution 1912-1923</a><br>
  Author(s) Horne John<br>
  Abstract: What happens if we enlarge the time frame of the Great War? European and world politics were militarised well before the war. In both Ireland and the Balkans, the violence that fed directly into the war started in 1912–13, as William Mulligan has shown in chapter 1. Continued militarisation of politics and far worse violence prolonged the fighting beyond 1918. In fact, the Great War was the epicentre of a larger cycle of conflict that did not finish until 1923, with the end of the war between Greece and Turkey, the resolution of the crisis over German reparations—which<br>

  Abstract: The way of the cross is adversarial, yes, but the embodied expression of that way under conditions of empire is neither violent tactical maneuvering nor passive endurance. Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform. This chapter turns to the second defining characteristic of Jesus’ way of the cross after its adversarial politics: the forging of dramatic action. It points to the<br>

  Abstract: With this chapter, we come, now, to stand on the precipice of action, as we begin the first of two chapters interpreting the way of the cross as “building peoples’ movements.” A book does not create action; it might, though, create spaces where we open ourselves toward it. In a book, perhaps, we can measure ourselves and the needs of our era—exposing, feeling, and thinking through the injuries and pain created by structural violence, “fingering its jagged grain,” as Ralph Ellison is oft-quoted to have said of the blues’ musical impulse.¹ That impulse will be needed if we are<br>

  Abstract: Building people’s movements amid and against Lockdown America also includes organizing against the U.S. death penalty, which at the federal and state levels assigns death as penalty for over 60 crimes.¹ Opposing it is surely no more important than the demilitarizing of policing in the U.S. or decarcerating the nation, which I have discussed in the previous chapter. Nevertheless, work against the death penalty is no mere add-on, some “extra-issue” to be raised. Instead, it is intrinsic, or ought to be, to our work against the carceral violence encountered in U.S. policing practice and mass incarceration, as well as in<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jfxn">Contemporary Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: This introductory chapter seeks to identify the key theoretical literature in International Relations (IR) which can be used to explore contemporary violence. Albeit in an exploratory fashion, this chapter will touch upon the work of scholars concerned with meaning in IR. Equally, the chapter recognises the broad body of work on conflict and new wars.¹ This work illustrates how paramilitaries, international aid groups, human rights organisations, transnational media-corporations, militias and inter-governmental organisations are all involved in contemporary war. Drawing on this premise, this book argues that conventional theoretical accounts of war in IR are no longer adequate – if indeed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jfxn">Contemporary Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: Some – if not all – contemporary wars are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons by an increasingly diverse set of actors. One corollary of this may be a reading of a broader spectrum of political violence which is neither exclusively political nor military, but is in part shaped by cultural and social forces captured in narrative. Even if narrative approaches have a long provenance in other disciplines, they have only recently touched the shores of IR. And yet, an approach which addresses accounts of narrative identity does much to capture the social, cultural and ontological assumptions which inform our<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will introduce Kosovo and Chechnya as examples of contemporary conflict. Delving into the history and geopolitics of Kosovo and Chechnya will help, insofar as it draws attention to a range of features, as well as a range of similar and dissimilar trends which inscribed the character of violence. These trends and features may be discernible in mythic stories of war and identity. In this way, analysis of geopolitical legacies and historical narratives provides valuable and often neglected insight into both regions.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jfxn">Contemporary Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: A substantial amount of theoretical literature now exists in both International Relations and political theory which explores how culture impacts upon violence. As yet, however, this body of literature has not been applied fully to analyse the move to war in either Kosovo or Chechnya.¹ Aside from exploring the cultural construction of an enemy – enemification – and locating this within a broader body of work on colonialism and post-colonialism, this chapter argues that stories play an important role straddling the divide between culture and politics. In many ways stories interpenetrate these two realms – aided, as mentioned in Chapter<br>

In doing so, attention has been drawn to different levels of analysis, the role of history in the Caucasus and Balkans, and different social, cultural and local forms of identification. In both Kosovo and Chechnya we see contract soldiers, special police units and federal army units fighting against armed resistance movements. The armed resistance movements were, however, made up of a multiplicity of groups and networks, and this, alongside the role of NATO, the UN and other<br>

  Abstract: Following the First World War, countries across Europe were met with unprecedented challenges from new political ideologies; namely Communism and Fascism. Throughout 1934, following the general elections in November 1933, violence in parts of Spain erupted. By 1936, the steady decline into chaos was replaced with the start of a full-blooded civil war. Although subsumed in literature about the Second World War, historians have raised questions about the origins and implications of the Spanish Civil War, asking, for instance, how the local milieu impacted upon the character of the conflict and why left-wing volunteers – including dozens of Albanian and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: According to Marcus Borg, Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem was a counterdemonstration, as Pilate’s troops were also entering the city from the opposite direction to reinforce the garrison on the Temple Mount during Passover. Jesus’s entry, modeled on Zech 9:9–10, symbolized the peaceful kingdom of God. Peaceful, yes, but with active resistance through public criticism and symbolic acts. For, to our surprise, Jesus has recourse to violence in the temple! His pacifism must thus be qualified: it is “bifocal.” Toward the Roman occupation, its aspect is of nonresistance, but toward the temple personnel and the perversion of their mission, it<br>

  Author(s) DORON DANIELLA<br>
  Abstract: In the wake of World War II, politicians and parents alike proclaimed that they had just endured “a war against children.” In the war’s aftermath, the consequences of Nazi violence, Allied air bombings, and family separations were most commonly presented in terms of the suffering endured by Europe’s youngest citizens.¹ While this concern for children was genuine and eminently reasonable, it also served a political agenda.

  Abstract: The shock of World War I contributed to a crisis of reason and loss of confidence in the humanist foundations for modern secular utopianism.¹ For some, the ideal of material progress became synonymous with the creation of more efficient weapons of mass destruction. And for many artists, romantic yearnings to express the imagination were channeled toward a growing aestheticization of violence.² One of the consequences of this crisis in European culture was the renewal of interest among Jewish and Christian intellectuals in the history of apocalyptic and messianic hopes.³ According to Gershom Scholem, an interest in the messianic has always<br>

  Abstract: “The entire Torah, in its minute descriptions, is concentrated in the ‘Thou Shalt not kill’ that the face of the other signifies,”¹ writes the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas. Aside from finding a confirmation in Jewish doctrine, this sentence sums up Lévinas’s thought as a whole—a radical ethic of nonviolence that, reached through the author’s anomalous reading of the sixth commandment, can serve as an introduction to our theme here. We begin with Lévinas because we believe in the rhetorical efficacy of contrasts. And, in this case, the contrast is considerable. Against almost all tradition, Lévinas reads the commandment as<br>

  Abstract: No matter how often it sings the praises of peace, the Bible abounds with massacres and wars carried out against the enemies of Israel in the name of God. The cultural semantics of monotheistic religions are notoriously characterized by a crude and ferocious vocabulary of violence.¹ The episode of the golden calf may serve as an example. There an infuriated Moses shouts: “This is the message of Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Gird on your sword, every man of you and quarter the camp from gate to gate killing one his brother, another his friend, another his neighbor.’”² As for<br>

  Abstract: In 1984, delivering a speech commemorating peace in Europe, Emmanuel Lévinas underlines how the West lacks “a sensibility in which the scandal of murder is not suppressed even when the violence is rationally necessary.”¹ If the vitalist mask of the subject holds war inevitable and even healthy, the rationalist mask holds it all the more necessary to secure peace. Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Abstract: In one of his last studies on colonial cinema, Marcel Oms inquires into the question of the genre’s aims and limits.¹ Pertinently, he highlights the near-absence of allusions to military conquest, from Algeria to sub-Saharan Africa to Indochina. Watching these films, one has the impression that these things never even happened, as if France had simply come into possession of these territories naturally. Colonization is presented as being around, as always having been around. Hardly ever does its origin of violence and opposition taint the silver screen.

  Abstract: Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed. Another reason for anti-Algerian sentiment was the fact that this labor immigration was organized<br>

What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  Abstract: Over the course of his distinguished interdisciplinary career, Giles Gunn has sustained his focus on the continuing threats to our collective sense of the human that seem to result from the link between the collision of fundamental values and the increase of systemic violence. He asks whether such threats can be at least mitigated, even if not removed, by understanding as opposed to force and what resources a more pragmatic cosmopolitanism might provide for doing so. How, in other words, might our sense of the human be reconstructed, not around suspicion or antipathy toward others, but around an epistemological and moral need of them?<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

  Book Title: Luther and Liberation-A Latin American Perspective<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: With the approach of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s inauguration of the Protestant Reformation and the burgeoning dialogue between Catholics and Lutherans opened under Pope Francis, this new edition of Walter Altmann’s Luther and Liberation is timely and relevant. Luther and Liberation recovers the liberating and revolutionary impact of Luther’s theology, read afresh from the perspective of the Latin American context. Altmann provides a much-needed reassessment of Luther’s significance today through a direct engagement of Luther’s historical situation with an eye keenly situated on the deeply contextual situation of the contemporary reader, giving a localized reading from the author’s own experience in Latin America. The work examines with fresh vigor Luther’s central theological commitments, such as his doctrine of God, Christology, justification, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology, and his forays into economics, politics, education, violence, and war. This new edition greatly expands the original text with fresh scholarship and updated sources, footnotes, and bibliography, and contains several additional new chapters on Luther’s doctrine of God, theology of the sacraments, his controversial perspective on the Jews, and a new comparative account with the Latin American liberation theology tradition.<br>

  Book Title: The Literatures of the French Pacific-Reconfiguring Hybridity<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Hybridity theory, the creative dissemination and restless to-and-fro of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space or of Stuart Hall’s politics of difference, for example, has opened up understandings of what may be produced in the spaces of cultural contact. This book argues that the particularity of the forms of mixing in the literatures of the French Pacific country of New Caledonia contest and complexify the characterisations of hybrid cultural exchange. From the accounts of European discovery by the first explorers and translations of the stories of oral tradition, to the writings of settler, déporté, convict, indentured labourer and their descendants, and contemporary indigenous (Kanak) literatures, these texts inscribe Oceanian or Pacific difference within and against colonial contexts. In a context of present strategic positioning around a unique postcolonial proposal of common destiny, however, mutual cultural transformation is not unbounded. The local cannot escape coexistence with the global, yet Oceanian literatures maintain and foreground a powerful sense of ancestral origins, of an original engendering. The spiral going forward continually remembers and cycles back distinctively to an enduring core. In their turn, the Pacific stories of unjust deportation or heroic settlement are founded on exile and loss. On the other hand, both the desire for, and fears of, cultural return reflected in such hybrid literary figures as Déwé Gorodé’s graveyard of ancestral canoes and Pierre Gope’s chefferie internally corrupted in response to the solicitations of Western commodity culture, or Claudine Jacques’ lizard of irrational violence, will need to be addressed in any working out of a common destiny for Kanaky-New Caledonia.<br>

  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

In addition, in some countries single incidents of violence have led to calls for a commission when the facts about the event remained in the dark for decades.

However, their historiographical function has been generally overlooked by transitional justice scholars, as well as historians.¹ It is understandable that temporary panels established primarily for human rights investigation, rather than the publication of professional historiography, fail to draw attention to their engagement with the past. In addition, not all truth commissions complement forensic investigation with a historical narrative. Nonetheless, many truth commissions do take part in academic and nonacademic controversies over the causes, patterns, and consequences of political violence: “The<br>

  Abstract: The enormous variation across truth commissions in terms of goals, findings, recommendations, and impact is explored in Chapters 5 and 6. Truth commissions’ explanations of the under lying causes of past violence and violations exhibit considerable variation as well. No doubt some of the differences owe to the context in which violations happen, as well as the nature of the violations themselves.

  Abstract: In what ways do truth commissions transform the ways in which citizens of contemporary societies think and speak about historical truth, justice, reconciliation, and official historiography? Transitional justice mea sures, and truth commissions in particular, try to raise awareness around histories of violence and violations in the context of rebuilding state institutions and national identity.¹ Most truth commissions combine meticulous human rights investigation with a critique of the national past in order to rebuild the nation.² Aside from pursuing such goals as delivering a measure of justice and reconciliation, avoiding future violence, strengthening democratic institutions, and enhancing peace and stability,<br>

  Author(s) FRIEDLANDER ELI<br>
  Abstract: In various places in Benjamin’s writing the divine is identified in the total passing away and disappearance of the phenomenal. Probably the most famous case for such annihilative characterization of the divine occurs in the essay “Critique of Violence.” Yet, the account of divine violence in that essay, with its intimation of active destruction, tempts one to construe the moment of disappearance in terms of catastrophic effects wrought by God on the physical world, on the model of a force that makes visible changes in reality. This problematic figuration of the catastrophic in Benjamin’s vision of history might hide a<br>

  Abstract: In her reading of Walter Benjamin’s “Critique of Violence,” Judith Butler provides a persuasive interpretation of the critical resources Benjamin mobilizes. She points out that Benjamin draws on an alternative Jewish tradition of understanding the commandment “Thou shall not kill.” In her analysis, the commandment is opposed to a principle of guilt and hence can become the basis for a critique of legal violence. Moreover, according to Butler, the commandment, as Benjamin conceives of it, constitutes the condition for a theory of responsibility that would be fundamentally concerned with the ongoing struggle with nonviolence.

  Abstract: The experience of war and occupation profoundly shaped the politics of French intellectuals in the years after the Liberation. The sacrifices and suffering of the war years created a popular “expectation of justice”¹ and a desire for radical social and political change among intellectuals. The wartime division of friend and enemy, resistor and Nazi, between whom no middle ground was possible, brought intellectuals into a Manichean world in which refusal to choose sides became a choice for an intolerable status quo.

  Abstract: White supremacy holds that the interests of people of European descent are superior to those of people who believe, act, or look differently than” normal.” It perpetuates the stratification of class, race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender. It embraces Nazism, fascism, and violence. Its open manifestations are extremist hate groups; its results are political and social systems based not on the democratic ideals of majority rule, tolerance, diversity, equality, and justice, but on “white is right.” White supremacists are America’s deepest nightmare because they attack not only individuals and groups, but the legitimacy of our democratic process itself.<br>

  Author(s) EZEKIEL RAPHAEL S.<br>
  Abstract: From the Reconstruction era to 1945, between 3,000 and 5,000 black Americans were killed in mob violence, much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan. Some victims were hanged or burned to death; often men’s genitals were mutilated. Later, during the civil-rights struggles of the 1960s, reincarnations of the Klan spread terror and death, burning buses, clubbing demonstrators, and bombing homes and churches. Today we see another white racist movement, with Klansmen joined by neo-Nazis, racist skinheads, and members of intensely racist churches.

The Malino Peace Agreement in early 2002, following three years of intermittent violence, left a city divided into “Christian” and “Muslim” territories, with up to ten thousand persons killed and close to seven hundred thousand displaced, equaling one-third of a total Moluccan population of 2.1 million, including those fleeing violence on<br>

A decade and a half after the Rushdie affair, the old religious denunciation of “blasphemy” had reared its head again among Muslims in Europe and beyond, seeking to undermine hard-won freedoms.

They have also spent the greater part of their lives interpreting and discussing their experience in a language almost entirely shaped by ideology. These aspects of their mental world lend special resonance to the work of collecting and analyzing their memories. In their case, too, the controversial term “collective memory” has real meaning.

  Abstract: The social and spiritual context of human beings suggests that the refusal of grace, as much as its acceptance, is not just an inner or individual phenomenon. Yoder’s sociological theology unsurprisingly casts sin in broad structural and cosmic terms. The powers are fallen, meaning, the created social structures are now badly malformed. God’s intended peaceful order has been disrupted and violence is the norm. As a Christian pacifist, Yoder was concerned to expose how violence is implicated in the everyday language and practices of Christians. Some critics argue that he was so focused on violence that he lost sight of<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: This book has been a sustained attempt to revise John Howard Yoder’s sociological theology so that it might better avoid charges of reducing theology to sociology, method to ideology, and expansive Christian witness to narrow socio-political perfectionism. Pierre Bourdieu’s relational sociology has been the primary tool of revision, as it enables amendments to Yoder’s social theoretical assumptions that render them more clearly non-reductive. Several of Bourdieu’s key concepts were put into conversation with Yoder’s theology of the principalities and powers, his broader

Does the “rule of compassion” deliver justice for both victim and wrongdoers? How can victims forgo retaliation—and the concomitant renunciation of violence—without denying their right to justice? Jesus’ command to “turn the other cheek” appears to invite the wrongdoer to further acts of aggression and violence. How might ordinary victims of everyday wrongs capture the imaginative vision of Gandhi or Martin Luther King? Or does their extraordinary example make justice without retaliation<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we contrasted Kohut with a broad stream of the Western tradition that has focused on the darker dimensions of the human condition. From this darker perspective, something is inherently wrong with us. Our destructiveness, violence, and capacities for evil emerge from an inherited blueprint that is self-seeking and corrupt. In contrast to this Augustinian/Freudian emphasis on out-of-control drives, we examined the more optimistic view of Kohut. While acknowledging the human capacity for destructiveness, Kohut refused to see that destructiveness as a part of our basic nature. Instead, psychological deprivations and distortions promote the human dilemma. The<br>

The violence of our late-modern age, furthermore, seems embedded in competing claims about boundaries and identities and what some philosophers call our relationship to “The Other.” Some people cheerily claim that boundaries are (or soon will be) no more, since modern technologies are shrinking the walls and distances that separate us. Such shrinkage will, these optimists argue, render<br>

The choice of Levinas and Derrida as interlocutors is not arbitrary. As well as the far-reaching influence of Levinasian and Derridean thought, not unimportant is the extent to which their respective philosophies have been shaped by their own life experiences of inhospitality, exclusion and violence. Such experiences have led them to the conclusion that not only is Western thought ill-equipped to respond to the inhospitable and unethical<br>

On the one hand, in our contemporary context in which genocide and religiously motivated violence are, sadly, all too familiar, with the Old Testament being something of an embarrassing ‘no go area’ for many Christians owing to its apparent collusion with genocide, a reading like the one proposed here might provide a renewed way of engaging wholeheartedly with our more difficult yet nonetheless cherished texts.

It also leaves us with the global risks of political violence and terrorism, economic globalization and financial crisis, and environmental destruction and global climate change.

  Author(s): Vincent Alana M.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

More broadly, diverse groups and individuals across the religious spectrum have been involved in violent actions: so-called Christian groups blow up abortion clinics for the purpose of killing health professionals involved with acts of abortion; Jewish fundamentalist groups defend militarily their perceived religious right<br>

  Abstract: At this point, I want to present a justification for turning to the insights of the Catholic Canadian theologian and philosopher, Bernard Lonergan. While Lonergan’s works do not specifically concern themselves with religiously motivated violence, his insights nevertheless address the problem of violence by examining the performance of the subject as subject and by providing a philosophical analysis of the self-transcending subject. Lonergan postulates a set of foundational categories for discerning how we come to have religious knowledge, an explanatory account of historical progress and breakdown in human history, and a way forward for recovery in history that is achieved<br>

                  cosmoswithin the symbol of cosmic war. We saw that the designation ofcosmicwar that linked violence, divine will, and warfare within a cosmologically oriented mindset was imprecise, especially when dealing with religious groups who demonstrate that their cultures have achieved, if only partially, an anthropological breakthrough. A better, more nuanced understanding of the religious agent’s horizon would be to categorize it in terms of a grace–sin dialectic but that carries the danger of cosmic dualism, and consequently a lack of appreciation<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I engage dialectically with the idea of martyrdom, the second of Juergensmeyer’s symbols for understanding the link between violence and religion. I critique his claim that religious martyrdom and self-sacrifice are simply ritualized rites of destruction that in the eyes of religious agents leave the impression of a religious heroism that transforms history. Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>

In this chapter, I will argue that without a heuristic account of evil, people will be unable to discern why demonization continues the cycle of violence. We will see that social exclusion and humiliation provide for the emergence and survival of demonizing processes, while acts of dehumanization escalate those processes to the point where those demonized are robbed of their subjectivity. Emerging out of situations where there is an imbalance of power, I will demonstrate the role of

  Abstract: Juergensmeyer’s fourth symbol for understanding the link between violence and religion is warrior empowerment, which joins two interrelated aspects: the practice and code of the warrior, and the empowering of the warrior. Although Juergensmeyer’s title chapter uses the term “warrior” to structure his analysis, he does not use the term in the body of his writings, preferring to refer to “fighters” and “soldiers.”¹ However, there is evidence that the term “warrior” has been used in communities, for example, the

These symbols were: cosmic war, martyrdom, demonization, and warrior empowerment. I engaged dialectically with each of these symbols, using the insights of Bernard Lonergan, and through that engagement, I addressed a number of questions: What are the truthful and mistaken assertions made by authors through the lenses of these symbols around the link between religion and violence? Are there better categories to understand religiously motivated violence?<br>

  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Moser Walter<br>
  Abstract: Cet ouvrage vise à éclairer deux problématiques actuelles, l'intermédialité - l'interaction des représentations médiatiques - et l'interculturalité - l'interaction des cultures. Trois questions principales guident les contributeurs au volume : Comment les médias se sont-ils inscrits dans le processus actuel de mondialisation culturelle ? Quelles sont les images d'autres cultures qu'ils construisent ? Dans quelle mesure les médias exercent-t-ils une violence par rapport à d'autres cultures qui n'ont pas l'habitude de se représenter dans les genres médiatiques de l'Occident ? Pour y répondre, les auteurs explorent le rôle des médias dans la connaissance de l'Autre, la violence interculturelle et la mondialisation. Ils découvrent que le fil conducteur réside dans la tension entre mondialisation et réappropriation, entre images stéréotypées et images complexes, entre violence médiatique et formes de résistance.<br>

Il soutenait la nécessité de considérer le fait de partager une même culture moins comme une caractéristique définitive que comme le résultat d'une activité constante. Pour lui, cette activité devait être saisie dans sa dimension relationnelle liée au pouvoir. Par pouvoir, on entend une violence légitimée, c’est-à-dire appropriée par une institution qui s’impose et qui est reconnue. C'est dire que certains groupes vont, à une certaine époque, se constituer en nation, tandis que d’autres seront des ethnies à l’intérieur d’une nation<br>

  Book Title: Slavery's Capitalism-A New History of American Economic Development<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rockman Seth<br>
  Abstract: During the nineteenth century, the United States entered the ranks of the world's most advanced and dynamic economies. At the same time, the nation sustained an expansive and brutal system of human bondage. This was no mere coincidence.
         Slavery's Capitalismargues for slavery's centrality to the emergence of American capitalism in the decades between the Revolution and the Civil War. According to editors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman, the issue is not whether slavery itself was or was not capitalist but, rather, the impossibility of understanding the nation's spectacular pattern of economic development without situating slavery front and center. American capitalism-renowned for its celebration of market competition, private property, and the self-made man-has its origins in an American slavery predicated on the abhorrent notion that human beings could be legally owned and compelled to work under force of violence.<br>

  Author(s) SCHERMERHORN CALVIN<br>
  Abstract: What is a slave ship? Such vessels are among the most emblematic features of slavery’s Atlantic history. Transatlantic slaving vessels were floating dungeons whose names evoke a “way of death,” illustrated by the iconic
                  Brooks, theZongmassacre, and theAmistaduprising. That “vast machine” was a race-making technology, a site of demonic cruelty, and an instrument of violence. Yet the slave ship looks different when viewed in its coastal U.S. configuration. Like their transatlantic and riverine counter parts, U.S. coastal slave ships were “floating engines of capitalism,” but in the 1810s and 1820s most ships plying the domestic saltwater<br>

  Book Title: Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KALISA CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender. This study advances our understanding of the attempts of African and Caribbean women writers to resolve the tension between external forms of violence and internal forms resulting from skewed cultural, social, and political rules based on gender.<br>

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: By sharing a history dominated by the violent disruptions of slavery, colonialism, and latent neocolonialism, African and Caribbean peoples belong to what Francoise Lionnet calls “geographies of pain.”¹ Caribbeanist Jack Corzani identifies various forms of this historical violence. Physical violence manifests itself in the enslavement and killing of Africans and in the dispossession of their continent; in the fights between masters and slaves, between colonized and colonizers, and among colonizers themselves; in abolitionist struggles; and in several postcolonial revolutionary wars (Corzani 15). Figures such as the soldier or the policeman symbolize the violence used to maintain colonial regimes in Africa<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dfnvj2">Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Critical studies of African and Caribbean women writing remain scarce.¹ The reasons for this absence are twofold. First, at the beginning of the formation of African literary studies in the mid-twentieth century, there were relatively few women writers in Africa and the Caribbean. This was mainly due to the external violence of colonialism, which privileged the schooling of the male. It was also attributable to internal violence originating from precolonial and postcolonial patriarchal conceptions that prevented women in traditional and contemporary societies from expressing themselves or acquiring the same educational level as men. Maryse Conde writes, for example, that “comme<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I posit that the selected works by Michèle Lacrosil, Ken Bugul, and Ousmane Sembène complicate Fanon’s formula for colonial violence by offering a specifically female perspective on the experience and legacy of colonialism’s brutality. This chapter discusses these relationships in two different areas. First, I examine the process of epistemological violence — brainwashing through formal and informal education — as a legacy of colonialism. Second, I study the specificity of women’s experience within the colonial discourse. This involves a close analysis of Ken Bugul’s violent encounter with the West and Lacrosil’s depiction of a severe case of<br>

  Abstract: In her article “Sheroes and Villains: Conceptualizing Colonial and Contemporary Violence against Women in Africa,” Amina Mama locates the source of contemporary African models of patriarchal violence in colonial states. These states not only used the famous colonial formula “Ayons les femmes et le reste suivra” [Let’s win over women and the men will follow] (“L’Algérie se dévoile” 18; “Algeria Unveiled” 37) but also adopted European concepts of womanhood such as repressive domestication. Patriarchal violence combines European models of violence against women with models of patriarchal oppression that existed both before and after colonialism.

  Abstract: Calixthe Beyala and Gisèle Pineau explore further the concept of “geographies of pain” by depicting intimate space, language, and the body as sites of pain, exile, and resistance to violence.¹ In the tradition of women’s literature, the two writers turn their attention to internal sources of violence and, through their characters, condemn those who still focus solely on the external factors of violence. They ask questions such as: How can women successfully re-territorialize their violated bodies within the intimate spaces from which they have been exiled? How can they overcome linguistic limitations in expressing pain? Beyala sees linguistic violence as<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine how women writers redefine war in their writing about political violence. The term
                  warnormally refers to a “hostile contention by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or between parties in the same nation or state; the employment of armed forces against a foreign power, or against an opposing party in the state” (Oxford English Dictionary Online). This definition needs to be expanded to include several consequences of war with a disproportionate impact upon women, such as sexual violence; the destruction of family and the loss of husbands, sons, and<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: As African and Caribbean writings become ever more
                     intimistes(intimist) — as authors present more intimate and deeply private topics — an examination of the subject of violence and particularly its gendered form in literature is crucial to the understanding of Francophone women writers. Reading violence in postcolonial women’s literatures entails understanding the tension between public and private violence that results in gendered violence. While it can be argued that gendered violence is a corollary to imperialism and colonialism, women writers show how their societies contribute to gendered violence.<br>

We live indeed on the continent supposed to have invented “History” as opposed to “Myth,” the continent that furthermore brought History to America and imposed it upon the Natives through the violence of the Conquest. History and Myth have always collided in myriad directions that have found their way into contemporary literature, and in a particularly forceful way in the writings of many Native North American authors.

  Book Title: Écritures de la réclusion-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Ferrer Carolina<br>
  Abstract: Le thème de la réclusion, cette forme de violence directe qui consiste à limiter la mobilité physique d’un sujet, traverse la littérature. En effet, l’expérience de l’enfermement, de cet espace-temps intermédiaire créé par la contrainte, a inspiré l’œuvre de plusieurs auteurs. Peu importe la forme que prend l’enfermement, fictif ou réel, dans des contextes de violence explicite ou implicite, les écritures de la réclusion mettent au jour les liens entre le politique, le social et le traitement qu’en fait l’art. Les auteurs de cet ouvrage explorent l’expression de la réclusion, que ce soit dans la littérature hispano-américaine postdictatoriale, en particulier dans le roman Le fourgon des fous de l’écrivain uruguayen Carlos Liscano, en contexte antillais dans l’œuvre de Patrick Chamoiseau, dans les classiques africains, dans Lefeu ou la démolition de l’écrivain autrichien Jean Améry, dans les aveux de comploteurs guinéens, dans le contexte du Centre de rééducation civique de Tcholliré au Cameroun ou encore dans l’œuvre du célèbre auteur d’origine togolaise Kossi Efoui. Une entrevue inédite avec ce dernier conclut par ailleurs l’ouvrage, qui offre un cadre large et varié pour réfléchir aux violences institutionnelles faites aux collectivités et aux individus, à leurs modes de fonctionnement et à ce qu’en fait l’art, la littérature en particulier.<br>

  Abstract: La réclusion fait partie de cette forme de violence directe qui vise le sujet en limitant sa mobilité physique¹. Nous entendons par « écritures de la réclusion » les diverses formes d’expression écrite qui rendent compte de cette expérience de l’enfermement visant à contrôler les sujets selon un principe de localisation « forcée » et d’assignation à un lieu². Cette assignation devient un espace-temps intermédiaire, entre mobilité et contrainte, dans la prise en otage du sujet. Cette question suscite un grand intérêt chez plusieurs auteurs, qui traitent dans leurs oeuvres les diverses formes de l’enfermement dans des contextes de violence<br>

  Abstract: Les écrivains de la Caraïbe n’ont de cesse de souligner la frontière poreuse entre le colonialisme et le postcolonialisme. De Maryse Condé à Édouard Glissant en passant par Patrick Chamoiseau, plusieurs ont mis l’accent sur le « néo » que cache bien souvent le « post », ce préfixe devenu incontournable dans la critique universitaire. Pour Glissant, on le sait, les départements français d’outre-mer dont fait partie la Martinique sont des colonies modernes, de sorte que les blessures – concrètes ou symboliques – sont des violences coloniales plutôt que postcoloniales, d’autant plus « dangereuses », selon lui, qu’elles sont insidieuses<br>

  Abstract: Si la science politique s’est peu attardée à la notion de responsabilité, la philosophie quant à elle s’en préoccupe depuis plus de deux millénaires. La responsabilité demeure néanmoins difficile à cerner, puisqu’elle renvoie aux relations que les individus et les collectivités entretiennent avec les codes sociaux et moraux. Elle touche à la fois au droit, aux normes et à l’hésitation durable entre volonté individuelle et déterminisme socioculturel. L’objectif du présent chapitre est d’interroger la notion de responsabilité dans un cadre spécifique, soit celui de la violence envers les femmes.

  Abstract: Quel rôle l’État devrait-il jouer dans la résolution d’un problème social qui relève historiquement de la sphère privée ? La judiciarisation de la violence conjugale demeure le moyen choisi par plusieurs gouvernements, dont celui du Québec, pour soustraire cette problématique de l’ordre du privé. Cette position est parfois contestée par les différents acteurs qui prennent part à la lutte pour enrayer la violence conjugale. De nombreux enjeux animent les débats relatifs à cette responsabilisation collective du problème. Il devient donc essentiel de tenir compte du contexte historique derrière la mobilisation des États, des différentes politiques gouvernementales en place au Québec<br>

Quoiqu’essentielles, les seules interventions auprès des victimes ne sauraient permettre une lutte efficace contre ce problème social.

  Abstract: Depuis 1993, date d’une série de conflits internes et régionaux qui se sont déroulés sur le territoire de la République démocratique du Congo (RDC), les femmes et les filles ont été massivement victimes de viols, d’enlèvements, d’esclavage et d’esclavage sexuel, de grossesses forcées, de prostitution forcée, de mutilations sexuelles et de tortures de nature sexuelle (Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme des Nations Unies, 2010). Selon une extrapolation de données récoltées en matière de violence sexuelle par une équipe de chercheurs, 1 310 000 femmes congolaises auraient subi de la violence sexuelle au cours de leur vie¹.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1f11751">Responsabilités et violences envers les femmes</a><br>
  Author(s) Zweyer Marina<br>
  Abstract: Violence against women (VaW) and girls is widespread worldwide, has serious health consequences, and is considered a major public health problem (WHO 2010). Considering only intimate partner violence (IPV), globally, between 15% to 71% of women experience it during their lifetime (Garcia-Moreno
                  et al. 2006). Given that violence may have short-, medium- and long-term adverse health effects, women exposed to violence are frequent users of health services (Kruget al. 2002). For instance, among women attending accident and emergency departments in the UK, the prevalence of IPV was estimated between 22% and 35% (Federet al. 2009). Clearly, physicians and<br>

  Author(s) Hagemann-White Carol<br>
  Abstract: Violence against women was neither recognized as a significant problem, nor was it studied empirically, until women’s political action in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the success of grassroots feminist activism in creating hotlines, shelters, and counseling centres for women made men’s violence visible as a widespread social problem and a structural element in gender relations. Thus, in much of Western Europe, addressing violence against women began by creating places of safety and support for victims.<br>

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal a political gap at the heart of the universal itself.<br>

Commissioned without the authorization of the municipal council by a group of citizen-led associations, the statue’s illicit unveiling in the midst of a state-led ceremony was intended to alert Nantes’s politicians to the need for a permanent memorial site (Chérel, 2012: 58).

  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of keywords in and contributors to this volume, please go to: http://ow.ly/4mZZxV<br>

  Abstract: The Niger Delta is where Nigeria’s plagues of political gangsterism, corruption, and poverty converge. What is happening in the Niger Delta is nothing short of a militarized insurgent struggle against the violent machinery of state security forces with a terrible reputation. At the same time, there is something distinctive about this violence; the militants’ struggle is a backlash against a long history of exploitation, the presence of transnational oil corporations, a style of politics dependent upon violence, and myriad groups, gangs, and cults with no leadership as such.<br>

Indeed, one cannot write about energy culture in the Nigerian context without engaging the spectacle of violence it elicits, both in the public mind and in the sphere of creative imagination, precisely because the form of sociality that oil energy generates in cultural production is imagined and inscribed in idioms of violence. My concern here with this concept of violence is less with the destructiveness it inflicts (which is considerable) than with the intricacy of its operation<br>

Redress assumes, not a saving intervention that might prevent acts of violence and expropriation in the present, but an address to the past from which we are disjoined by the very history of which effective violence is a constitutive part. In relation to the violence of the past, we seem helpless, impotent to set right the injustice that has so forcefully shaped the very times that we inhabit.

  Author(s): Boyd Gregory A.<br>
  Abstract: In an epic constructive investigation, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God addresses the tension between Scripture’s violent depictions of God and the non-violent, self-sacrificial God that was supremely revealed on the cross. Over two volumes, author Gregory A. Boyd develops a theological interpretation of Scripture that he labels a “cruciform hermeneutic," and he argues that this cruciform way of reading Scripture reframes its violent divine portraits in a way that subverts their violence and that discloses how they bear witness to the revelation of God’s non-violent love in the crucified Christ.<br>

  Abstract: While theologians within the historic-orthodox church have always viewed Christ as the most important revelation of God, they have, especially since the fifth century, also generally assumed that the plenary inspiration of Scripture entails that the OT’s violent portraits of God must be accepted as accurate revelations alongside of Christ. Rather than seeking for ways to reinterpret the violence found in these portraits as a means of preserving a nonviolent conception of God, the way Origen, Nyssa, and others had done, these theologians sought for ways to justify the violence these portraits ascribe to God.

  Abstract: In this chapter I will address a widespread feature of narratives in the OT that I believe further confirms not only of the Principle of Redemptive Withdrawal but also of the previously discussed Principle of Cruciform Accommodation. It concerns the curious fact that biblical authors frequently depict God engaging in acts of violence that their own narratives and/or the broader canon make clear God merely allowed. I will refer to this as Scripture’s “dual speech pattern.” I will argue that by acknowledging that God merely allowed the actions they elsewhere ascribe directly to God, these OT authors confirm both that<br>

  Abstract: We have thus far seen that humans who are bent on violence are not the only agents that afflict people when God decides he must withdraw his protective presence to allow one form of evil to punish another form of evil. Rather, as the cross supremely illustrates, and as the Principle of Cosmic Conflict expresses, Satan and other cosmic powers are also present, looking for every opportunity to kill, steal, and destroy. Hence, whenever God stops holding these “raging waters” at bay (Ps 124:4–6), they too become a means by which people experience the destructive consequences that are inherent<br>

  Abstract: Because of my commitment to treat all Scripture as “God-breathed” as well as my commitment to the Conservative Hermeneutical Principle, it is not enough for me to demonstrate how violent depictions of God bear witness to the cross. Since the cross leads me to deny that God acted violently in any biblical narrative of divine judgment, I must offer some alternative account of who brought about the violence that is attributed to God in these narratives. We have seen that this is unproblematic in narratives in which violently inclined people function as instruments of God’s judgments (vol. 2, chs. 16<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kk665x">Revelation and Convergence</a><br>
  Author(s) Schloesser Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Although it has been twenty-five years since Linda Schlafer investigated the seminal importance of Flannery O’Connor’s encounter with the work of Léon Bloy (1846–1917), scholars have been slow to follow her lead.² Yet Bloy’s literary style, indelibly marked by rhetorical violence and vitriolic humor, sounds much like characterizations of O’Connor’s own “language of apocalypse” and “imagination of extremity.”³ Moreover, Bloy’s privileging of “suffering” as redemption apparently responded to O’Connor’s felt need for what Ralph Wood has called a “darker reading of human misery, a more startling revelation of transcendent hope.”⁴ Perhaps most important, Bloy’s symbolist vision of history—the<br>

  TWO  Imagery and the Landscape of Desire from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: In all of Seneca’s plays the psychological atmosphere depends heavily on imagery. In the Phaedra images of fire, enclosure, and heaviness and the contrasting imagery of interior and exterior space depict the stifling emotional world in which the characters seem entrapped. Against this mood of constriction, however, Seneca sets elaborate rhetorical descriptions of sky, forest, or sea. The concentrated energy of such descriptions sets into sharp relief the protagonists’ ineffectiveness or helplessness in the face of the emotional violence within and around them.<br>

  THREE  The Forest World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: The emotional violence that Phaedra releases from Hippolytus’ ostensibly peaceful landscape reveals the contradictions in his character and the precariousness of a personality that uses violence as a defense against sexuality. Seneca owes the basic structure of the situation to Euripides, but he develops it with a density and consistency of imagery that produce an entirely new way of presenting character.¹<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Reconstruction Thought: from:

  Abstract: Post-war reconstruction in Europe presented formidable, in fact unprecedented, tasks. They were, above all, material. But the challenges were also moral and symbolic. While the Holocaust was to remain marginal to thinking about the war at least until the 1960s, the meaning of mass violence and atrocity was immediately debated by political thinkers across the continent. After all, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s more people had been ‘killed by their fellow human beings than ever before in the history of humankind’.¹<br>

  4  Two Cheers for the Argument Culture from:

  Abstract: IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS, I have discussed confusions that can be traced to academia’s ways of fogging over its conversations. Some observers, however, complain that what characterizes the academic scene is not “conversation” so much as smash-mouth combat. I have taken flak myself for arguing that conflict and controversy should be made more central in the curriculum. My critics object that today’s academia, like today’s popular media, is all too rife with conflict of a distinctly ugly and unedifying kind. The critics point to talk-show violence, political attack ads, and other signs of a pervasive “Gotcha!” spirit that aims at<br>

  Book Title: Abraham's Children-Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

  1  Calling Abraham’s Children from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq07j">Abraham's Children</a><br>
  Author(s) CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: There is a familiar narrative of religiously motivated violence. It claims a long and unbroken chain from antiquity to the present of the intolerance on the part of religious groups, especially the Abrahamic religions, toward members of other religious groups. It is a narrative of violence, oppression, torture, and war. This highly selective narrative omits any of the goods that religions have brought to the world and is deeply caricatured. Many of its claims are blatantly false. Sadly, because of its influence, it needs to be retold, reconsidered, and reevaluated.<br>

  Abstract: Now that Mel Gibson’s

Once the film entered the public domain, most of the fears about whether it was anti-Semitic dissipated, leaving only some concern about the possibility that in certain parts of the globe anti-Semites might use the film to incite violence. The other question—wouldThe Passion’s graphic violence keep people away from the theaters—has been answered with a resounding no. The numbers<br>

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1994 
                  itsembabatutsi (genocide against the Tutsi¹), in which over 800,000 Rwandans were murdered,² cultural discourses around the world and in all media have frequently reiterated the Kinyarwanda metaphor inyenzi (cockroaches). Although this trope can be traced to 1960s Rwanda – when the pro-Tutsi FPR (Front patriotique rwandais-Rwandan Patriotic Front) employed it as a political self-designation³ – global cultural discourses on the Rwandan Genocide focus almost exclusively on “inyenzi” as wielded by the RTLM (Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines) and Kangura (Wake Up) to incite violence. Often incorporating international human rights concerns, these cultural discourses reiterate the cockroach<br>

  Abstract: More than 60,000 Canadians died during the First World War (1914–18), ten per cent of those who enlisted. More than 150,000 were injured. Over one million Canadians served between 1939 and 1945; 45,000 of them died, and 55,000 suffered injuries in a conflict marked by unprecedented violence on both sides. While a significant number of Canadian artworks from these wars depict the destruction meted out on the built, manufactured, and natural environments, the subject of physical violence is rare. Nonetheless, whether the soldiers, airmen, or sailors were from the allied or combatant sides of the conflicts, a survey of<br>

  Author(s) KOZOL WENDY<br>
  Abstract: Critics of the U.S. War on Terror have long called for an alternative optic to the relentlessly myopic perspective of American news media. The presumption behind this call to look elsewhere is that doing so will reveal images that are authentic or compelling enough to disabuse American spectators of their ambivalence about the casualties of militarized violence. This logic imagines the grisly “truth” of war to happen somewhere beyond or outside the frame of mainstream representations of combat. What happens, however, when conflict photographers who seek visually graphic and affectively searing images of war find evidence of its banality instead?<br>

  Abstract: Early in the twenty-first century, late one evening, war took an interest in me. The first feint came in an e-mail, an invitation to address a conference in Australia on “War 2.0.” Unlike most numerically annotated wars signifying duration or repetition, “2.0” clearly intended a new, different, and possibly improved version of organized violence. Upon opening, however, the attached invitation disappeared in the blink of an eye behind a pop-up message of menace: “Warning: Security software updates are now available for your computer.

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

  From Persecution to Hope: from:

  Author(s) DECKERT JENNIFER CHAPPELL<br>
  Abstract: In colombia, there is an adjective used to describe motherly love:
                  amor entrañable. The literal translation ofentrañableas “close/intimate” does not completely describe the intent of the word in Spanish, which implies love that is strong, protective, nurturing, and instinctual (Paul Stucky). The Mennonite church in Teusaquillo, Bogotá has created a space for victims of political violence, which serves as a protective womb, where victims enter vulnerable and desperate and find hope, generosity, and a commitment to peace and justice. The response to thisamor entreñableis reciprocal and restorative. The repetitions of giving and receiving, grieving and celebrating<br>

Motivated by a desire to analyse women’s life stories, and informed by many years as a midwife, I took on the task of retelling a life story revolving around the centrality of the character’s bodily experience of womanhood, manifested through her experiences of rape, intimate violence, birth, and mothering.

  Abstract: Posters of China’s Cultural Revolution occupy a prominent but paradoxical place in the memory and imaginary of Mao’s China; they elicit complex and contradictory responses among diverse audiences, Chinese and global. Some, particularly those who experienced the political persecution and physical violence of the era, see them as unwelcome reminders of an oppressive and brutal regime. For others, they recall lost dreams of youth, and yearnings for a socialist future of justice and equality.¹ For yet others, they represent the imagined certainties of a past structured by order and stability.

The letters between Abelard and Heloise are among the world’s most vibrant embodiments of
                  fin’amor,¹ as well as its most tragic testaments to the violence and determination of those who would prevent men and women from living and loving as they choose. Written around 1128, this Latin correspondence tells a story of love that is both of the body and the mind.<br>

  Abstract: After a lengthy period of neglect within criminology, the study of men’s violence towards female partners gained a high profile during the 1980s as a consequence of feminist activism and feminist research with victims and survivors. Attention was drawn to the pervasive and extensive nature of violence against women, the greater danger posed by men that women know (as opposed to male strangers), the continuous relationship between physical and sexual assaults and emotional abuse, and the criminal, sometimes fatal, consequences of this abuse (Dobash and Dobash, 1980; Kelly, 1988; Hester et al, 1995).

Even against the “guilty,” violence involves an idolatrous and preemptive exploit of the divine prerogative. This is more than merely “God on our side.” Whether it is in the death penalty or war, the exercise of official violence generally presumes to know or to execute (which is to say, usurp) the judgment of God who alone holds the power of life and death.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7j16">Engaging the Powers</a><br>
  Abstract: Violence is the ethos of our times. It is the spirituality of the modern world. It has been accorded the status of a religion, demanding from its devotees an absolute obedience to death. Its followers are not aware, however, that the devotion they pay to violence is a form of religious piety. Violence is so successful as a myth precisely because it does not seem to be mythic in the least. Violence simply appears to be the nature of things. It is what works.

The gospel is not a dualistic myth of good and evil forces vying for ascendancy, as in the myth of redemptive violence. It is a sublimely subtle drama about the intertwining of good and evil in all of historical reality. The Powers are not simply evil. They are a bulwark against anarchy, and a patron, repository, and inspirer of art. They inculcate values that encourage interdependency, mutual care, and social cohesiveness. They encourage submission of personal desires to the general good<br>

Even before Jesus experienced its full fury against himself, he apparently predicted the outcome.² The Powers are so immense, the opposition so weak, that every attempt at fundamental change seems doomed to failure. The Powers are seldom content merely to win; they must win overwhelmingly, in order to demoralize opposition before it can gain momentum.

  Abstract: The new reality Jesus proclaimed was nonviolent. That much is clear, not just from the Sermon on the Mount, but from his entire life and teaching and, above all, the way he faced his death. His was not merely a tactical or pragmatic nonviolence seized upon because nothing else would have “worked” against the Roman Empire’s near monopoly on violence. Rather, he saw nonviolence as a direct corollary of the nature of God and of the new reality emerging in the world from God.

Violence “saves.” It is “redemptive.” All we have to do is make survival the highest goal, and death the greatest evil, and we have handed ourselves over to the gods of the Domination System. We trust violence because we are afraid. And we will not relinquish our fears until we are able<br>

Even where nonviolent resistance was successfully used, it tends to be neglected. A people kept ignorant of the existence of the history of nonviolence will naturally believe that it is impractical and unrealistic.

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: This book is concerned with the aporias, or impasses, of forgiveness, especially in relation to the legacy of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. Banki argues that, while forgiveness of the Holocaust is and will remain impossible, we cannot rest upon that impossibility. Rather, the impossibility of forgiveness must be thought in another way. In an epoch of "worldwidization," we may not be able simply to escape the violence of scenes and rhetoric that repeatedly portray apology, reconciliation, and forgiveness as accomplishable acts.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr64j">Spiritual Grammar</a><br>
  Abstract: She holds a rod and a switch in her right hand and a book in her left. These pedagogical implements make Grammar recognizable, as do the two children below her, one kneeling and the other with head bowed. The southern Portail Royal of the western façade of Chartres Cathedral (ca. 1145–50) thus personifies Grammar as a disciplinarian and schoolteacher. Indeed, the discipline of grammar was largely about rectitude,¹ enforced by violence, as symbolized by the rod and the switch. None of the other Seven Liberal Arts of medieval European learning was represented in twelfth-century iconography as a teacher.² Grammar,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr6c5">The Origin of the Political</a><br>
  Abstract: It might seem that the path traced thus far in Arendt’s thought can best be characterized as the squaring of a circle, as the forging of a lineal solution for the antinomic relation between originality and duration, deconstruction and constitution, violence and power. But things are more complex than they appear to be at first sight. If we take a closer look at the hinge that conjoins and absorbs the “before” and the “after,” we can see that it does not develop without gaps or remainders. As such, in order to guarantee the success of a differential translation of war<br>

  Abstract: In “The Peasant Marey” (
                  Diary of a Writer, February 1876, chapter 1, section 3), Dostoevsky recalls how as a convict in a Siberian prison, early in Easter week, 1850, he recoiled in horror before the depravity and violence of his fellow convicts. The words of a Polish political prisoner addressed to him on this occasion, “Je hais ces brigands,” seem to express his own sense of disgust, hatred, and despair. Dostoevsky writes that he lay down on his bunk in the barracks a few moments later and recalled, in a daydream, a childhood encounter with the kindly peasant Marey.² As<br>

  Abstract: Three things may be said about the lifelong polemic of Maxim Gorky (1868–1936) with Dostoevsky. First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Book Title: Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHOTT ROBIN MAY<br>
  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

  3  Irigaray’s To Be Two: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0w2">Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil</a><br>
  Author(s) Jaarsma Ada S.<br>
  Abstract: As this epigraph signals, an awareness of “sin” emerges out of Luce Irigaray’s central assertion of sexual difference as the essential ethical and philosophical problem. Irigaray asserts that a rejection or refutation of sexual difference risks committing an ultimate sin. Through this claim, we can glimpse a problematic of evil emerging out of Irigaray’s project that cannot be easily or quickly delimited. Irigaray herself traverses this problematic in her texts, elaborating sources of brokenness and violence as well as concomitant possibilities for regeneration (see, e.g., 1993b, 1993d, and 1996). Rather than mobilizing traditional concepts like “moral evil” or “natural evil,”<br>

  Abstract: September 1944 was a relatively calm month for the remaining Jews of Dresden. The deportations had stopped, incidents of blatant violence had decreased, and Germany’s defeat seemed certain. On 14 September, Klemperer found the peace of mind to write a sort of reflective summary of past events. The entry begins with encouraging reports of the Allies’ progress on the various fronts. In this context, he describes how his friend and neighbor at the Jews’ House, Neumark, found a newspaper from 1943, in which a series of reports all point to the military and political collapse of Germany.

  Book Title: The Colonial Legacy in France-Fracture, Rupture, and Apartheid<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pernsteiner Alexis<br>
  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  Abstract: In May 1945, Marshal Georgii Zhukov declared: ‘We have stormed Berlin, but we have yet to conquer the Germans’ souls’. His prophecy that the conquerors would achieve ‘a glorious victory […] on this front as well’¹ was, however, not to be fulfilled. The legacy of Nazi propaganda, a fear of revenge, a disavowal of their crimes and guilt, the violence of the advancing Red Army, the constant threat of robbery and plunder, the shock of defeat – all of this led most Germans to reject Soviet governance.

  Author(s) Bărbulescu Ana<br>
  Abstract: Between 1940 and 1944 the Romanian authorities imposed broad antisemitic legislation that led to the exclusion of the Jewish minority from all levels of society. The Jews from the Old Kingdom of Romania were subjected to two major outbreaks of violence: the pogroms in Bucharest (January 1941) and Iaşi (June 1941). The pogrom in Bucharest led to the killings of 125 Jews, while the one in Iaşi resulted in as many as 14,850 Jewish deaths.<br>

  Abstract: During the period of Donald Tuzinʹs impressive fieldwork—from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s—themes of traditional male cults and masculine assertion in Melanesia (MMM1) had special purchase in the anthropology of Oceania and more widely. By the 2000s, another triplicate—of mobile men with money (MMM2)—has gained particular purchase (for example, Lepani 2008), along with various other dimensions of modern masculinity. In many of these more recent treatments (see Taylor 2008), Melanesian masculinity is often seen through the lenses of guns, drunkenness and pronounced, often brutal, male violence.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Case study chapters address the relatively unknown history of South Asian American rhetorical performances from the early 1800s to the present. Avant-garde feminist performances by the Post Natyam dance collective appropriate women's folk practices and Hindu goddess figures make rhetorical claims about hate crimes against South Asian Americans after 9/11. In
      Yoni ki Bat(a South Asian American version ofThe Vagina Monologues) a progressive performer transforms aspects of the Mahabharata narrative to address issues of sexual violence, such as incest and rape. Throughout the volume, Garlough argues that these performers rely on calls for acknowledgment that intertwine calls for justice and care. That is, they embed their testimony in traditional cultural forms to invite interest, reflection, and connection.<br>

  Abstract: As part of the human condition, innumerable manifestations of violence challenge us during the course of our lives. Around the world, people struggle daily to respond with dignity as they are subjected to terrorist acts, war crimes, racist speeches in public forums, physical and sexual abuse in the home, or deafening silence in response to requests for acknowledgment. Diverse as they are, these forms are undeniably interrelated. As I argued in the initial chapters of this book, hate speech performed in everyday contexts has often made exceptional violence—like religious genocide—appear reasoned or just (Das 2007).

  Abstract: Christian eschatology and otherworldliness have been used and misused throughout history. On the one hand, they were used by Christians to justify maintaining the socio-political or religious status quo resulting in either a tragic neglect of social injustice or a passivity toward social reforms in the present age.¹ On the other hand, they were used to justify socio-political and religious radicalism and violence to the point that Christianity may be seen in some quarters as a militant opponent of social process and tolerance.² While it is true that the eschatological orientation and “otherworldliness” of early Christian teachings did not directly<br>

Some human beings cope well when faced with them, and others do not. Specialists call this capacity to do well in adversity “resilience.” Psychosocial research has documented three types of resilience phenomena: good outcomes in the midst of high risk (coping), sustained competence under stress (constancy), and recovery from trauma (constructing).² In order to track these resilience phenomena, researchers have changed their perspectives and methods.³ Moral theologians can benefit from these sciences’ insights into how humans<br>

  Abstract: Some modern and postmodern philosophers favor violence as a means of outflanking authoritarian forms of peace and philosophy, and find promising concepts of violence in the great philosophers, above all in Hegel. This motivation is not altogether incorrect, but perhaps there are other ways besides violence to slip out of classical constraints. Kenneth Schmitz’s philosophy of freedom is, among other things, a move away from modern violence philosophies. Yet with all his classical philosophical commitments, Schmitz is as modern a philosopher as there is, particularly regarding the modern proof of unconditioned freedom. For these reasons, his work is not only<br>

From these unjust wars came a dawning sense that a just peace was necessary to prevent their recurrence and right the scales of injustice.

Ecclesiastical and “lay” tribunals—the distinction here is merely relative—plus bishops, inquisitors, parish priests, and confraternities all kept their eye on society’s basic cell. Via open repression and charitable aid, all aimed to discipline behavior and punish transgressions that clashed with the family model imposed and sacralized by the Council of Trent.

  Abstract: Pre-Axial religion in archaic societies was replete with sex and violence. Ideally, sex and violence should be treated together, because both are associated with tribal survival as well as with forms of antisocial ecstasy and excess.

They used big words—“genocide,” “ethnic cleansing,” “sectarian violence,” and “communal violence”—that sounded bulky and alien to Punjabi ears, words that hardly ventured into the contemporary archive. For contemporaries who were victims, perpetrators, as well as mere witnesses, there was fear to contend with, a strange, polarizing fear to which they were not accustomed.

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

It became fashionable to speak of a “clash of civilizations,” and suddenly, new forms of violence were apparently acceptable.

Concrete interests, many believed, had given way before apocalyptic visions.

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

Capitalism is an extremely violent social system, but that violence is mostly symbolic in the bourgeois boardrooms and in the middle-class experience. In the inner city, where poverty is extreme, the violence is literal and very real. It is the dark side of the American way, of the American dream. But it is, essentially, the same system.

  Author(s): MAYER ARNO J.<br>
  Abstract: In his sweeping yet close comparison of the world's two transnational revolutions, Mayer follows their unfolding--from the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Bolshevik Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited Masses; the escalation of the initial violence into the reign of terror of 1793-95 and of 1918-21; the dismemberment of the hegemonic churches and religion of both societies; the "externalization" of the terror through the Napoleonic wars; and its "internalization" in Soviet Russia in the form of Stalin's "Terror in One Country." Making critical use of theory, old and new, Mayer breaks through unexamined assumptions and prevailing debates about the attributes of these particular revolutions to raise broader and more disturbing questions about the nature of revolutionary violence attending new foundations.<br>

  Abstract: There can be no revolution without counterrevolution; both as phenomenon and process, they are inseparable, like truth and falsehood. They are bound to each other “as reaction is bound to action,” making for a “historical motion, which is at once dialectical and driven by necessity.”¹ The struggle between the ideas and forces of revolution and counterrevolution was a prime mover of the spiraling violence inherent to the French and Russian revolutions.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Violence from:

  Abstract: Violence is as inseparable from revolution and counterrevolution as these are from each other. Violence has, of course, many faces and purposes. Certainly not all violence in revolution is ideologically driven and, by that token, excessive and boundless. Although violence is inherent to revolution, it is not unique to it. Nor is it as rare as revolution itself. Violence is basic to society and polity, especially to their foundation and consolidation. At the creation there is often recourse to war, which, like revolution, is “inconceivable outside the domain of violence.”¹ The founding myth of nearly every society or state romanticizes<br>

Since 1789 it has challenged and humbled social theorists and historians who strain to strike an equitable balance between engaged and distanced explanation. In the wake of Auschwitz, the Gulag, andHiroshima, terror has become an even more disconcerting and controversial issue than it was during the century following the Furies of the French Revolution. Indeed, scholarly and popular debates about the reasons, functions, and effects of generic terror have been both enriched and complicated by the questions raised by students of the singularities of the Furies<br>

But for there to be terror there must be vengeance and violence. While vengeance, fired by quasi-religious fervor, belongs to the inner recesses of terror, violence pertains to its instrumentation. With the breakdown of sovereignty and the rule of law, revolutionary moments see a reversal in the vector of vengeance: from being directed outward in order to foster in-group solidarity it turns inward, with the result that it fosters discord and<br>

  Abstract: Looking at contemporary humanity, one can hardly avoid the impression of a huge body or organism ravaged by multiple diseases and even catastrophes.¹ Even without detailed diagnosis, it is not hard to trace these ailments to a set of underlying factors or causes: political oppression or domination; radical inequality between rich and poor; xenophobia sometimes resulting in genocide; terrorist violence; and the abuse of religions and ideologies. If such ailments occurred on a small scale or in a limited group of people, efforts would quickly be made to find remedies to combat the existing ills. However, if they happen on<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1930s and early 1940s the “myth-makers” of the New York avant-garde, including Adolph Gottlieb, Jackson Pollock, Richard Pousette-Dart, and Mark Rothko, made paintings that referred to atavistic myth, primordial origins, and primitive rituals and symbols, especially those of Native American cultures.¹ Barnett Newman began to work in a similar fashion about 1944 and was influential as a theorist and indefatigable promoter of this new art. The “myth-makers” shared a tendency to depict ritual violence or inherently violent myths as well as an archaism exemplified by biomorphic forms and, often, coarse surfaces.

  Author(s) Cohen Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: The first encounter between Jews and Muslims dates back to the very beginnings of Islam. This essay discusses the foundations of the Muslim-Jewish relationship. The ambivalent attitude toward the Jews of Medina in the Qur’an, and the Prophet Muhammad’s aggressive assault on some of the Jewish tribes, reflect the gulf between his expectations for their acceptance of his message and their rejection. At the same time, Muhammad guaranteed nonviolence toward the “People of the Book” (Jews and Christians) in return for payment of tribute and humbleness. Muhammad’s so-called Constitution of Medina incorporated Jews either as part of the Islamic

  Abstract: In the Muslim societies of the Middle Ages, Jews and Christians had the status of
                  dhimmīs, protected but at the same time inferior. In the Christian kingdoms of the Middle Ages, Jews and sometimes Muslims lived under similar conditions with respect to the Christians. But their status became increasingly precarious in many European countries. Minorities were subjected to violence and expulsions. For example, the Jews were expelled from France in 1182, again in 1306, and once more in 1394; from England in 1290; from Spain in 1492; and from Portugal in 1497.

  Abstract: The Middle East at the closing quarter of the eleventh century was a rich multiethnic and multireligious mosaic. The Jewish population of the Eastern Mediterranean constituted one of the ancient components of this variegated society. The conquest by the Franks, that is, the Crusaders, did not change this reality; in the first decade of the Latins’ rule, the Jews suffered heavily from the violence of the newcomers. This was also the fate of the Muslim communities in cities along the seacoast and in Jerusalem.<br>

  The Case of Lebanon: from:

  Author(s) Schulze Kirsten E.<br>
  Abstract: Jewish-Muslim relations in Lebanon before the twentieth century on the whole were characterized by amicability. Jews lived among Sunnis, Shi‘a, and Druze, and had well-functioning trade and communal relations with all of them. The nature of Jewish-Muslim relations, however, changed with the emergence of the Palestine conflict. The first strains in Sunni-Jewish relations appeared with the 1936–39 Arab Revolt. This set the pattern for sporadic violence against Lebanon’s Jews, which was motivated by solidarity with the Palestinians from the 1930s onward. The rise of pan-Arabism further underlined these sentiments, particularly among Sunni politicians. Shi‘a-Jewish relations did not become strained<br>

  Abstract: Consider statutes and judicial decisions, two of the most common legal artifacts. If one accepts that statutes are not enacted by legislatures and that judicial decisions are not made by courts with a view to applying to foreign legal cultures, then legal borrowing across legal cultures is the practice of interrupting intention, which is a form of epistemic violence.¹ Statutes and judicial decisions nonetheless regularly find themselves being imported across legal cultures—that is, across cultures and languages—in order to underwrite local reforming agendas.

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish. In the developing culture of ubiquitous truth reports, Phelps argues that we must become attentive to the form these reports take-the narrative structure, the use of victims' stories, and the way a political message is conveyed to the citizens of the emerging democracy. By looking concretely at the work and responsibilities of truth commissions,Shattered Voicesoffers an important and thoughtful analysis of the efficacy of the ways human rights abuses are addressed.<br>

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence. The pendulum of possible responses swings without pausing from the extreme of traditional retributive justice—requiring investigations, trials, and punishment<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhzvq">Clan Cleansing in Somalia</a><br>
  Abstract: This book deals with the changing use of clan- based violence against civilians as a technology of power in the Somali civil war (1978–present). At its center is what I consider the violence of the “key shift,”¹ activated by politico-military leaders in the course of the armed uprising that culminated in the expulsion of President Maxamed Siyaad Barre on January 26, 1991. This study argues that the violence that accompanied and followed the moment of regime and state collapse was analytically, politically, and discursively something new, a transformative turning point and key shift that has remained largely unaddressed (and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhzvq">Clan Cleansing in Somalia</a><br>
  Abstract: The research on which this book is based began as a study of Somali popular songs and poetry as mediations of civil war violence. This is a continuation of my earlier work on Somali popular songs of the nationalist era, a genre that, as I have argued elsewhere, proved to be iconic for this era’s will to modernity—its hopes for national unity and economic development as well as for a “modern,” autonomous, and desiring selfhood. In the era after state collapse, some of the most popular and widely known poetic mediations of civil war violence have indeed continued to<br>

  Abstract: Scholarly analyses of violence, including this study, also constitute a type of mediation and a genre with its own rules, expectations, and pitfalls. Many scholars who have taken violence as their subject of study have been keenly aware that violence is an especially challenging, perhaps even distinctive subject matter (see Nordstrom and Robben 1995; Donham 2006; Lubkemann 2008). Thus Donald Donham argues in his essay “Staring at Suffering”: “violence is a different kind of representational object than market systems or kinship. . . . Violence is red. There is a kind of excess, an ambivalence of both attraction and repulsion<br>

Both evacuations involved dramatic rescue actions by land, sea, and air.² Groups of stragglers, especially Italians who worked in the city or the agricultural areas of Jubba and Jannaale, also managed to arrange for escape but had to leave all their possessions behind.³ By January 10 even most humanitarian workers had left the country to escape the violence.

  Book Title: The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LEMARCHAND RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: Endowed with natural resources, majestic bodies of fresh water, and a relatively mild climate, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa has also been the site of some of the world's bloodiest atrocities. In Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, decades of colonial subjugation-most infamously under Belgium's Leopold II-were followed by decades of civil warfare that spilled into neighboring countries. When these conflicts lead to horrors such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ethnic difference and postcolonial legacies are commonly blamed, but, with so much at stake, such simple explanations cannot take the place of detailed, dispassionate analysis.
      The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africaprovides a thorough exploration of the contemporary crises in the region. By focusing on the historical and social forces behind the cycles of bloodshed in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, René Lemarchand challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the roots of civil strife in former Belgian Africa. He offers telling insights into the appalling cycle of genocidal violence, ethnic strife, and civil war that has made the Great Lakes region of Central Africa the most violent on the continent, and he sheds new light on the dynamics of conflict in the region. Building on a full career of scholarship and fieldwork, Lemarchand's analysis breaks new ground in our understanding of the complex historical forces that continue to shape the destinies of one of Africa's most important regions.<br>

No other region has experienced a more deadly combination of external aggression, foreign-linked factionalism, interstate violence, factional strife, and ethnic rivalries. Nowhere else in Africa has genocide exacted a more horrendous price in human lives lost, economic and financial resources squandered, and developmental opportunities wasted. The scale of the disaster is in sharp contrast with the polite indifference of the international community in the face of this unprecedented human tragedy.

Nineteenth-century evangelicalism, in the North and the South, has typically been portrayed as women’s domain: women were more in attendance at congregational activities, and pastors bent over backward to accommodate theological ideals to feminine sentimentality even as the culture at large considered women more naturally inclined to spiritual and moral matters than men. Men, in contrast, and especially in the South, were beholden to a code of honor that, among other things, encouraged violence—martial, retributive, or vigilant—gambling, blood sports, sowing wild oats,<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

The essays collected here analyze the background of this problem in contemporary family life and society at large, with special emphasis on the role of women and on the Bible as a source of inspiration and transformation. The collection is the product of a six-year conversation on family, violence, and human dignity between the Protestant Theological University in Kampen, The Netherlands, and the Faculty of Theology at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, a North-South dialogue that included annual conferences, a series of responsive letters, and additional external responses.

In Lam 1–2, Jerusalem is personified as a violated woman, a woman invaded, raped, and humiliated.

  Abstract: Any investigation into the connection between family and violence is from the outset confronted by two almost opposing situations, particularly in a context where biblical texts are deemed to inform the notion of family. On the one hand, the family—defined in various ways and comprising of smaller or larger units of various structural forms—has proven to be a dangerous context for many people. This is attested to, for example, by abused spouses and neglected, maltreated children; it is communicated in personal testimonies, anecdotal reports, and research findings.

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

By way of a study of literature of and on the Putumayo by Latin American as well as US and European writers, Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier explores the history and enduring significance of this Amazonian border zone, which has been visited both physically and imaginatively by figures such as Roger Casement, José Eustasio Rivera, and William Burroughs. Travel writing, testimony, diaries, letters, journalism, oral history, songs, photographs, and ‘pulp’ fiction are all considered alongside more conventional forms such as the novel. Whilst geographically peripheral, the Putumayo has played a central role in Colombia and beyond, both historically and, crucial to this study, culturally, producing a literature of extreme experience, marginality, and conflict.<br>

  [Part V: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vk4c8">Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II</a><br>
  Abstract: As many of the contributors to this volume have argued, the face-to-face encounters at Pontigny-en-Amérique engendered fruitful, if subtle, shifts in the poetic, philosophical, and artistic exchanges between American and European culture. The formal and informal conversations that took place then may not have led to immediate or discernible outcomes. Nevertheless, more than sixty years later, their afterlife continues to occupy us. The contributions in this section embody the very essence of conversation as a form of action and of response to injustice and to imagining a world not prone to war and violence.<br>

  Abstract: The four photographs of Rachel Bespaloff—as a girl, as a young woman, and as an adult marked by the experience of exile—haunt us. The ghostly images are silent, even as the presence of this elusive and driven thinker is all around us, transported by the words of those who knew her and those who study her writing. Even as Bespaloff and many of the other Pontigny participants past and present wrote again and again of violence, I am struck by the ferment of creativity that emerged out of the encounters of Masson and Chagall, Stevens and Moore, and<br>

  Author(s) Ganeri Jonardon<br>
  Abstract: Hospitality, says Kant in “Towards Perpetual Peace”, is a cosmopolitan right, the right of a stranger to make use of that shared possession of the human race, the surface of the earth, to visit other places, the right “not to be treated with hostility because he has arrived on the land of another” as long as no violence is committed upon the host.¹ What might it mean to say that the stranger has a right to hospitality when the movement involved concerns texts and ideas? Viewed from the other side, what does it take for a tradition to have the<br>

  Abstract: Although
                  Hadji Murad(1896–1904) is, as we have seen, a story in which violence seems indivisible from fiction, Tolstoy spent most of the years of its authorship developing, publicizing, and trying to live by the precepts of his religious philosophy. His most important work espousing nonviolence in these years wasThe Kingdom of God Is within You(1893). Nonviolence united Tolstoy’s dreams for a communal brotherhood of man with his increasingly strident opposition to the government and Russian Orthodox church. Was Tolstoy a hypocrite for preaching nonviolence while simultaneously writing sometimes lurid violent fiction? No, not in the ordinary<br>

  Author(s) Rose Deborah Bird<br>
  Abstract: Australian Aboriginal people manage conflict and seek resolution in ways that challenge mainstream Western practice and worldview. Attentiveness to place, relatedness, violence, emotions, and the inclusion of ancestral and nonhuman others are in many respects incompatible with key Western institutions that dominate Aboriginal and Settler people’s lives as a result of colonisation. And yet mutual accommodation between Australian Aboriginal and Western institutions and practices is possible. Globalised commitments to Indigenous people’s rights and the flexibility of institutions—when they are committed to fairness—help generate mutual accommodations across difference. Some Western institutions, particularly the law, have shown a willingness to<br>

  Author(s) Sugiono Muhadi<br>
  Abstract: Several centuries of interaction across ethnic and religious difference in the Indonesian archipelago have been accompanied by the evolution of local ways of resolving communal disputes and violence. We term the resulting norms and practices ‘local conflict resolution’. The development of these ways of mediating across difference has itself sometimes been violent, yet the accompanying local conflict resolution processes are dynamic and pluralist. They are open to revision and adaptation, including to the input of outside and new forces and actors. For this reason our use of the term ‘local’ does not connote a bounded space that excludes outsiders. Rather,<br>

  Abstract: Spend time at one of Japan’s busy commuter train stations and you will probably notice a bookstore crowded with silent rows of well-dressed “salarymen” and “salarywomen” browsing through an array of paperbacks and magazines. There, among the ubiquitous tabloids, the sex-and-violence comics, and the very latest Japanese and American bestsellers, you are likely to find several books devoted to the Zen master Taigu Ryōkan (1758–1831), a penniless monk whose life was spent in obscurity in Japan’s snow country, meditating, playing with children, and writing poems that vividly describe his world.

  Abstract: NATIVE AMERICAN history is the story and stories of a material oppression that I believe very few people would deny. It is a history of unparalleled genocide—eighty to one hundred million deaths, twenty million in the United States alone.¹ It is a history of violence perpetrated on multiple levels, including personal violence, whereby Natives were tortured, killed outright, torn from parents to be placed in boarding schools and foster homes, put on display at European courts and festivals, and made into spectacle as in the popular Buffalo Billʹs Wild West Show in the 1800s (Slotkin 165ff).

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Exegetical and Rhetorical Strategies for Ascetic Reading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rs06">Reading Renunciation</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I survey the various ways in which the church fathers produce ascetic meaning from Scriptural texts, especially those of the Old Testament. As will become evident, the degree of exegetical work needed to render these texts as messages of sexual renunciation varied considerably: in some cases, passages stood ready-to-hand for appropriation, while in others, textual displacement, or even textual violence, was necessary to extract an ascetic meaning. I here identify eleven modes of reading, some closely related, that were frequently used by ascetically inclined church fathers. Although these modes of reading often have recourse to figurative interpretations,<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  Abstract: Our examination of violence continues. By returning to the Estate Tamils, we return from a different direction to the questions of history and heritage, knowing and being, theory and myth; we arrive at the question of the historicity of history itself. We shall see that “ there is a structuring power in the living practices of a people that structures the effective aptitudes of every nascent generation, which exercised in its turn, ‘restructures’ the structuring power of that same people” (Margolis 1993: 18).

To mark this transition, I would like to begin by posing the tacit question in the manner of an open query. To what shall I compare the writing of this book? I shall compare it to the lowering of a tetrahedron¹ held by a string attached to its base into a liquid so that the point of the inverted pyramid, where the planes of three triangles meet, enters the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7srks">Charred Lullabies</a><br>
  Abstract: When violence is transformed into art—or even artful prose, be it reportorial or even analytic—its aestheticization is obvious. Art makes sense out of the senseless. The aestheticizing impulse, however, is less obvious in another creation of culture: the nation-state, that political work of art. The nation-state too promises to bring forth order out of disorder, mold form from that in which form is absent. But even though this order may be posited as a future hope, something to be achieved in the making, this hope is drenched in nostalgia, the imagined glory that once was. In South Asia<br>

  Abstract: What is human Being? I cannot think of anything more effective in urgently provoking one to ask this question than violence. This question has served as an undertone in all the chapters so far, but more noticeably in the last three chapters, with some conspicuous help from Peirce and Heidegger. But in our search for human Being in the world, we keep encountering human beings: the result of the pull of an anthropological attitude against that of a purely philosophical one. Anthropology has had an answer to the question, What is a human being? An answer that has, on the<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: It would be easy to assume that, in the eighteenth century, slavery and the culture of taste--the world of politeness, manners, and aesthetics--existed as separate and unequal domains, unrelated in the spheres of social life. But to the contrary,
         Slavery and the Culture of Tastedemonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time.<br>

He is tormented by a memory he cannot recall but is certain that it concerns an act of terrible violence. He also suffers from a mysterious phobic horror of objects decorated with parallel lines. By the film’s end, it is discovered that the phobia mirrors a visual element of his traumatic experience, which involved attempted homicide and accidental death on a downhill ski slope. Like many of the patients who speak on the following pages, the Gregory Peck character is chronically angry<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Abstract: I have four aims in this chapter. The first is to describe briefly something of the range of views that may fit under the heading ʺChristian nonviolence.ʺ The second is to give an account of the context out of which it makes sense to be committed to a certain kind of Christian nonviolence (ʺpacifismʺ). The third is to note how, from this pacifist perspective, the questions posed to just war theorists and realists are not the central questions about peace and war, and how focusing on them in fact distorts our thinking.

  Abstract: Though he discusses Christian nonviolence with scholarly care, Ted Koontz remains a passionately committed Christian. By insisting that the questions nonviolent Christians ask about the ethics of war and peace are different from the questions asked by those who approach the topic from other directions, he reminds us of the importance of religious convictions, or the absence of such convictions, in shaping how we understand war/peace ethics.¹ Moreover, his forthrightness in articulating the conceptions of truth and power that arise from the tradition of Christian pacifism, and especially from the practices of Christian worship, opens the way for a fuller<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Everyday War from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t6rs">War at a Distance</a><br>
  Abstract: Perhaps, these lyric poems propose, the weather can serve as a forceful wartime medium, broadcasting the voices or at least the sounds of distant violence, carrying in its currents an audible, palpable sense of suffering elsewhere. This was one way war at a distance could invade—affectively and effectively—the home front. An air-borne sense of suffering, however, escaped like involuntary sighs or moans from a growing, more rationalized understanding of global weather and global war. The new meteorology aimed to regularize violent extremes into an intelligible system, less felt than observed, and predicated on a predictable and continuous nature.<br>

  Abstract: This book began with the problem of modern wartime, that is, the problem of coordinating an awareness of violence elsewhere with everyday movements here, at a distance from the fighting. The book ends with the problem of cosmopolitanism. Another way of characterizing this trajectory would be to say it looks from the familiar scene at hearth and home to the more foreign scene of a suspension bridge set in a distant land—then looks back again. Holding together these two scenes is difficult: in one you might sit as a violent world comes to you; in the other you might<br>

  Abstract: “We have learned history and we claim that we must not forget it” (SNS 265, tr. 150). This is the most profound lesson that war taught French philosophy. Its violence exposed the hidden dependency of every way of life—economic, religious, artistic, philosophical—on a political sphere whose practices and disorders accumulate meaning almost imperceptibly over generations. If violence is not to rule public life, each domain must become aware of this dependency and alter itself to accommodate “history.” Even philosophers must learn to

  Abstract: Historical texts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries are, on the whole, accumulations of anecdotes. They lack the fundamental elements of narrative wholeness—a beginning, middle, and end—and they flagrantly defy the canons of proportion and clarity. And yet I have argued in this study concerning the Kingdom of God, their segmented and directionless mode of discourse was possible because it was, for the authors and the intended readers, informed by a general esthetic, namely, an esthetic of cult, which presupposed much that was unsaid in the said, including an acceptance of violence (beginning with sacrifice) as a medium<br>

Of course, violence tends, at the end of the day, to be the basis of war, while the other two, being modes of dialogue, are constitutive of politics. But whereas the politics of negotiation aims for accommodation, for resolving conflict through the making of trade-offs and concessions, those who converse strive instead for genuine understanding, for learning from each other and progressively transforming their positions so that they can be not compromised but integrated, reconciled. That is why only conversation is a matter of trying to “convince” people<br>

  Book Title: Rewriting Apocalypse in Canadian Fiction-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Goldman Marlene<br>
  Abstract: Rewriting Apocalypse in Contemporary Canadian Fiction is the first book to explore the literary, psychological, political, and cultural repercussions of the apocalypse in the fiction of Timothy Finley, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, Thomas King, and Joy Kogawa. While writers from diverse nations have adopted and adapted the biblical narrative, these Canadian authors introduce particular twists to the familiar myth of the end. Goldman demonstrates that they share a marked concern with purgation of the non-elect, the loss experienced by the non-elect, and the traumatic impact of apocalyptic violence. She also analyzes Canadian apocalyptic accounts as crisis literature written in the context of the Cold War - written against the fear of total destruction.<br>

Whereas Findley’s

As these fictions illustrate, apocalypse - far from being a quaint literary artifact that merely describes the categories of good and evil - functions as a vital, discursive mechanism for the

For in capturing the despondency surrounding a war to which there seems no foreseeable end, Ondaatje’s novel exposes the intractableness of a conflict that arguably rules out the possibility of a different, more peaceful future.<br>

  Abstract: This project originally unfolded in the context of the U.S.-led War on Iraq, and while that war has been peripheral to the explicit content of my study, it has shaped its driving ideas in immeasurable ways. Most obviously, it has confirmed my sense that the abandonment of the language of reconciliation for a discourse of enemy warfare and terrorism is a potentially fatal political decision. In making this move, the Bush administration orchestrated, wittingly or not, some of the most sordid acts of violence, some of the most tragic signs of the perverseness of a politics of revenge and retribution.<br>

  Book Title: Ghost Brothers-Adoption of a French Tribe by Bereaved Native America: A Transdisciplinary Longitudinal Multilevel Integrated Analysis<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BLUM RONY<br>
  Abstract: Devastating losses caused by diseases such as smallpox led to an epidemic of bereavement among the Natives. This loss resonated with the French, who had dealt with smaller epidemics in France and were also mourning their absent communities through a nostalgia for home. Blum traces how ghosts provided transgenerational and transcultural links that guided understanding rather than encouraging violence. Ghost Brothers insightfully examines the process of this colonial interdependent alliance between Native and European worlds.<br>

  Author(s) Curthoys Ned<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I discuss Hannah Arendt’s critique of revolutionary and anticolonial violence in her essay
                  On Violence(1969), which makes a critical distinction between violence and legitimate political activity. It has often been assumed that Arendt’s disquisition on the political dangers of violence was written in response to the growing militancy of the student movement and the appropriation of a rhetoric of violent revolution by the New Left in the United States, France, Germany, and other Western countries by the late 1960s. The Paris barricades of May 1968, the riots of that same year at the Democratic National Convention<br>

  Author(s) Shorten Richard<br>
  Abstract: To be found at the interstices of the current academic literatures on the relation between history and memory, on the nature and sources of modern political violence, and on the problem of totalitarianism is an idiosyncratic series of questions that has the effect of making the thought of Hannah Arendt acutely relevant. One of these questions—or, at least, the broad question that I have in mind—concerns how the historical experiences of imperialism, Nazism, and Stalinism might be both understood and situated

  Author(s) Duarte André<br>
  Abstract: It would be hard to find another thesis in political theory less questioned than the traditional identification of violence and politics. This is true to such an extent that the possibility of a nonviolent politics may seem chimerical, likewise that of tracing a conceptual distinction between power and violence. Even if it is true that not all violent phenomena are political phenomena, we tend to feel quite certain that there could be no politics without violence. As we know, Hannah Arendt is among those very few thinkers in contemporary political theory who refuse the strict identification of politics and violence,<br>

  Abstract: With few exceptions in academic literature concerning violence in Northern Ireland (Bell 1990; Jenkins 1983; Roche 2008; Roche 2007; Roche 2005a; Roche 2003), young people and their violent interplay have not held much appeal for social scientists. This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities. While no formal definition of this notion of “low-level” violence exists, its use in the Northern Irish context is widespread. Thoughts vary on the origin of the expression<br>

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

  Abstract: Since 9/11, the war on terror and the campaign for homeland security have increasingly mimicked the tactics of the enemies they sought to crush. Violence and punishment as both a media spectacle and a bone-crushing reality have become prominent and influential forces shaping American society. As the boundaries between “the realms of war and civil life have collapsed,” social relations and the public services needed to make them viable have been increasingly privatized and militarized.¹ The logic of profitability works its magic in channeling the public funding of warfare and organized violence into universities, market-based service providers, Hollywood cinema, cable<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

  Abstract: In its concern for achieving a greater adaptation of Christian doctrines to the contemporary social conditions of Latin America, liberation theology offers divergent views on many social conceptions inherited from the Baroque scholastic tradition. It also takes its inspiration from some Marxist theories concerning social structures and institutional violence, in order to respond to the new manifestations of poverty and oppression which are appearing in Latin American societies. Although Baroque scholasticism, Marxism and liberation theology agree on notions such as the “the finality of history,” the conflicts of interpretation between Christianism and Marxism have compelled the liberation theologians to reformulate<br>

  Abstract: The numerous narrative techniques available to represent war and violence must allow for the expression of an immense range of perspectives. It spans from the survey perspective of the historian to the personal experiences of participants in the war such as soldiers or civilians, from first-hand experiences to considering the impact on future generations. Representations oscillate between distance and proximity, between critical summary or analysis and personal experience.

  Abstract: The history of the term ‘avant-garde’ in Europe has been thoroughly documented by various continental scholars with no substantial disagreements about the early development and uses of the term.¹ The idea of an avant-garde was first coined in fifteenth-century France to describe the military unit at the fore of the army – the avant-garde was the group that defended the country and all it represented, and that, upon successful defence, pushed forth into new territory. The avant-garde used violence to protect and enlarge a nation’s territorial holdings. From this militaristic and nationalistic root, the term avant-garde transitioned from a literal implication<br>

  Abstract: The truest violence of law is not attributable to its errors, but to its essence. As a structure of meaning and a source of norms, framed through general and abstract standards, law has an especial, inevitable capacity to misrecognise ‘the other’ at the precise moment that the other is in most need of its justice. The significance of the other, upon which Levinas speaks with unparalleled philosophical authority, is instead personal, unique, singular, and fundamental in informing our understanding of ourselves, our desires and our duties.

However, as a limitless reaction, the worst violence arises from the essential nature of a limit. The essence of all limits is divisibility, which means, to say this immediately, that any attempt to reach a haven unscathed by violence, any attempt to reach a place behind an impervious wall, is impossible. Now, by means of the essential divisibility of any limit, we shall be able to present the formal structure of the problem. As we shall see in a moment, the<br>

  Abstract: If conflict is an intrinsic feature of democratic politics, then the manifestations of this conflict should be subjected to critical analysis to assess the extent to which they lend themselves to violence. This is particularly important because modern politics – especially in pious democratic forms – tends to deal with these conflicts in ethical terms constructed on a juxtaposition between democracy and violence. For this reason, evaluation of the ethics of conflict is fundamental to the arguments for and against democracy in contemporary politics, in particular the relationship between violence and democracy.

  Abstract: In this groundbreaking work, Lois Presser investigates the life stories of men who have perpetrated violence. She applies insights from across the academy to in-depth interviews with men who shared their accounts of how they became the people we most fear--those who rape, murder, assault, and rob, often repeatedly. Been a Heavy Life provides the discipline of criminology with two crucial frameworks: one for critically evaluating the construction of offenders own stories, and one for grasping the cultural meta-narratives that legitimize violence. For social scientists generally, this book offers a vivid demonstration of just how dynamic and contingent self-narratives are.<br>

But first it is necessary to take another look at heroism as a key plot in the men’s stories. The gendered nature of the heroic tale and the gender gap in violence signal the importance of cultural constructions of power, agency, and autonomy, to violence, which in turn suggests that narratives<br>

  Abstract: Arguing that the "letting die" element of biopolitics has been overemphasized, Yasmeen Arif zeros in on biopolitics' other pole: "making live." She does so by highlighting the various means and the forms of life configured in the aftermath-or after
         lives-of violent events in contexts of law, justice, community, and identity. Her analysis of the social repercussions is both global and local in scope. Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

With due restraint, this book does pose such a query, but with the following intent: how can the question of damaged life, in all its incessant living and dying, be posed as a query of the social? The possibility of answers is sought in archaeologies of the contemporary, in an assembly of locations of mass violence where such articulations could be found and which calls them

  Abstract: When the past is painful, as riddled with violence and injustice as it is in postapartheid South Africa, remembrance presents a problem at once practical and ethical: how much of the past to preserve and recollect and how much to erase and forget if the new nation is to ever unify and move forward? The new South Africa's confrontation of this dilemma is Martin J. Murray's subject in

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Buell Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: In a series of linked essays that span place, time, and discipline, Jeffrey Jerome Cohen brings together writers who illustrate the vibrant worlds formed by colors. Organized by the structure of a prism, each chapter explores the coming into existence of nonanthropocentric ecologies. "Red" engages sites of animal violence, apocalyptic emergence, and activism; "Maroon" follows the aurora borealis to the far North and beholds in its shimmering alternative modes of world composition; "Chartreuse" is a meditation on postsustainability and possibility within sublime excess; "Grey" is the color of the undead; "Ultraviolet" is a potentially lethal force that opens vistas beyond humanly known nature.<br>

  1.  The Ethics of the Dreamer from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttt3ph">The Dreams of Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) Pommier Gérard<br>
  Abstract: Initially it may seem strange to suggest that dreams contain ethical standards, as they often stage violence, murder, and perverse situations. To move beyond this apparent contradiction it is necessary to make the distinction between ethics and morals. Samurai warriors, gangsters, and politicians all possess ethical ideals dictating their codes of conduct. Both the gangster and the Samurai have codes of conduct based on the ethical standards of the groups with which these figures are affiliated. (In the case of politicians, this affirmation is less certain.) For example, a Samurai who chooses to commit

  Author(s) Feher-Gurewich Judith<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after
                  The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud’s discovery of the unconscious continues to sap the comfort of our received notions on love, desire, reproduction, violence, and death. Freud’s unconscious is a seductive delinquent, always on the go, tracking down desire and its infinite partial objects. Oblivious to debts, to logic and justice, it moves steadily toward death in search of the intervention of a father figure in front of whom it refuses to yield. No wonder that, among Freud’s epigones, Lacan stands quasi-alone to plead for that which defies the proper functioning of the law of social and<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of his narrative, Valentine Daniel lets the reader know how he stumbled upon Sri Lankan violence as an object of study. When he thought up his project in 1982, he had planned to write about UpCountry Tamil workers and to produce an alternative account of their history. He wanted to listen to their songs and use the lyrics to challenge the official, and quite abject, version of their story. He arrived in Sri Lanka a year later, in 1983, ʺon the heels of the worst anti-Tamil riots known to that island paradise to find that none of<br>

  Abstract: Why focus first on the ways that Henry Thoreau takes up and revises prophecy? A story can introduce the reasons. The week after John Brown raided Harpers Ferry in October 1859, Thoreau personally organized three public events so he could defend Brown and his raid. Public opinion in the North already cast Brown as a “monomaniac” and murderer, but Thoreau linked him to Puritans and Revolutionary fathers who, unlike enfranchised northern whites, would not sacrifice the principle of equality to expedience. Because the Dred Scott case effectively nationalized slavery, Thoreau argued, Brown’s self-sacrificing violence was needed not only to free<br>

  Abstract: Boundaries abound. Between humanity and the gods. Between human and animal. Between culture and nature. Between life and death. Between genders, nations, peoples, times, races, classes, and territories. But boundaries have also become problematic today, perhaps more so than before. In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence. Boundaries provide preconditions of identity, individual agency, and collective action; but they also close off possibilities of being<br>

  Book Title: Striking Beauty-A Philosophical Look at the Asian Martial Arts<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALLEN BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Striking Beautyexplains the relationship between Asian martial arts and the Chinese philosophical traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, in addition to Sunzi'sArt of War. It connects martial arts practice to the Western concepts of mind-body dualism and materialism, sports aesthetics, and the ethics of violence. The work ameliorates Western philosophy's hostility toward the body, emphasizing the pleasure of watching and engaging in martial arts, along with their beauty and the ethical problem of their violence.<br>

  Abstract: Martial arts practice is like sport but not sport and dancelike but not dance. It constantly refers to violence but refuses it a place in the training. The training is athletic, as it is in sport and professional dance, yet the competence that the martial arts teach stands apart from those of sport or dance by means of its external, instrumental value as a weapon. It is precisely this external, instrumental effectiveness, the weapons potential of martial arts, that accounts for the striking beauty of its movements.<br>

  EPILOGUE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/alle17272">Striking Beauty</a><br>
  Abstract: An aesthetic paradox of Asian martial arts is that something so warlike in conception should be beautiful to watch and joyful to perform. While designed for violence and visibly expressing that functionality, the martial arts are not practiced with a violent purpose and do no harm (although they certainly could). By suspending the dread of violence, the practice creates a theater in which to contemplate movements combining artful design with eloquent efficacy. But if you remove the training conventions and introduce unfeigned violence (as in boxing), the aesthetic serenity will vanish into the sometimes irrepressibly fascinating chaos of violence.<br>

His remarks describe the fine line between just and unjust war, evoking the principle that warfare is justified “if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.” But the speech also asked its audience “to think in new ways about the<br>

  Abstract: Norman Mailer’s essay “The White Negro” (1957) assaults its readers with existentially tinged racial fantasies of violence and liberation. In the piece, Mailer sought to celebrate a new figure—“the American existentialist,” otherwise referred to as “the hipster.” Pursuing his version of existential man, Mailer followed along a trail that Sartre had already blazed. Mailer intended by his bold embrace of criminal acts and a revolutionary cultural style to trump Sartre. Sartre had talked about the necessity of the novelist entering into a discourse with the era.

  Abstract: The social and political history of Lebanon—despite occasional manifestations of consensus, balance and harmony—has always been characterized by successive outbursts of civil strife and political violence. The brutality and duration of almost two decades of senseless bloodletting might have obscured some of the earlier episodes. Consequently, observers are often unaware that much of Lebanon’s history is essentially a history of intermittent violence. Dramatic episodes such as the peasant uprisings of 1820, 1840, and 1857 and the repeated outbreaks of sectarian hostilities in 1841, 1845, 1860, 1958, and the protracted civil war of 1975–92, reveal, if anything, the<br>

  Abstract: A defining element in Lebanon’s checkered sociopolitical history, one that has had substantive implications for the character and magnitude of collective strife, is the survival and reassertion of communal solidarities. In fact, the three overarching and persisting features—(1) foreign intervention, (2) the reawakening of primordial identities, and (3) the escalation of protracted violence—are all intimately related. This is, after all, what informs the major thrust of this study. We will, in subsequent chapters, identify and account for the various forms foreign intervention has assumed. More explicitly, an effort will be made to explore how the unresolved regional and<br>

  Abstract: When, why, and under what circumstances does collective violence become uncivil or drift into incivility? More concretely, how is latent enmity released into open but limited conflict and what exacerbates this hostility to assume the pathological manifestations of random and guiltfree violence? Other than implying, as is conventionally done in defining civil violence (i.e., that civilians rather than regular armed forces are engaged in such civil disturbances), what is so civil about civil violence? Can civil violence, in the first place, ever be civil? Is it not a rhetorical conjunction of incongruous terms, bordering on the oxymoron?<br>

  Abstract: There has been reawakened interest in the forms that peasant resistance are likely to assume, particularly in historical situations where open defiance is either impossible or entails considerable hazards (Scott 1985; Colburn 1989). Under such circumstances, it is argued, peasant resistance is prone to remain in the “hidden realm of political conflict.” Hence, it is less likely to take the form of open collective acts of violence such as riots, rebellion, sedition, or revolutionary movements. Since peasant uprisings, anyway, are “few and far in between,” it is more meaningful, Scott and Colburn tell us, to shift analysis to the more<br>

  Abstract: For almost a century, from 1860 to 1958, an epoch normally marked by internal, regional, and global turmoil in the lives of new nations, Lebanon was comparatively peaceful and free of any manifestations of civil strife or collective violence. Emerging from decades of bloody communal strife, it weathered the dislocations it was beset with as a plural society embroiled in the tumultuous transformations of a troubled region. Handicapped by a fragmented political culture, uneven development, dissonant growth, inept archaic polity, and deficient resources, Lebanon managed to evolve into a fairly liberal, democratic, prosperous, and vibrant little republic.<br>

  Abstract: This study is predicated on the overarching premise that much of the 
                     displaced and protracted character of collective strife that has beleaguered Lebanon at various interludes could well be a reflection of two other constant features of its fractious political history; namely the radicalization of communal solidarities and the unsettling, often insidious, character of foreign intervention. By probing further into the nature of this interplay one, it is hoped, can better understand when, how and why social strife becomes more belligerent and assumes some of the menacing cruelties of uncivil violence.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  Book Title: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican Visual Culture-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican visual culture appears here in a series of case studies taken in historical slices from the seventeenth century to the end of the twentieth century. Cosmopolitanism is understood here as an evolving complex of power relations with material, social, ideational, and affective manifestations, which unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. To associate cosmopolitanism with power is to suggest its compatibility with violence. I propose that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization generated and structured power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent<br>

Via critical analysis of writers and filmmakers whose projects have changed our ways of viewing the modern world-including Hannah Arendt, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, the directors ofGermany in Autumn, and Heiner Mueller-these essays furnish a cultural base for contemporary discussions of totalitarian domination, lying and politics, the relation between law and body, the relation between law and justice, the question of violence, and our ways of conceptualizing "the human."<br>

  Abstract: Before beginning, a few prefatory remarks appear necessary to maintain at least the hope for what Benjamin would have condemned: communication. Call it an act of violence, an act of communicative violence, if you will. But is not all language, that is, “impure” language, all language after the Fall, as Benjamin would say, violent? And does he himself not battle and ultimately fail in the face of language: fail either by instrumentalizing it as a tool for communication, or fail in failing to communicate, fail as a communicator, so to speak?<br>

  Abstract: Violent crime in popular entertainment is first and foremost a question of storytelling. On the most basic level, violence demands more story than does sex. Consider, for example, the extreme cases in popular entertainment directed at roughly the same demographic (men): in pornography, storytelling is kept to a minimum, since anything that is not overtly sexual is simply a distraction, and thus sex scenes can be strung together with the flimsiest of narrative threads (“Is that the delivery boy?”). In stories of violence, there is no precise narrative equivalent to pornography, as graphic violence tends to be much more motivated<br>

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer. Cecilia Hatt gained her D.Phil from Oxford University.<br>

Are there times and places on which tragic thinking can have no purchase?

The two tropes, of violence and nature, provide an entry point for a discussion of the development of the use of the idea of the African citizen in constructing national identity in Cuba.

As they are increasingly tied to Islam, however, these memoirs have become especially visible in the twenty-first century.¹ The similarity of these works is reinforced by marketing conventions, including sensational titles like

  Abstract: Nineteen sixty-eight was a year of mass violence: the Vietnam War, the crushing of student protest in Mexico, the Cultural Revolution in China—and, in East-Central Europe, the suppression of the “Polish March” and the Prague Spring. By comparison, little seemed at stake in Western Europe—which nevertheless produced most of the iconic images of’68. As was often pointed out, west of Czechoslovakia “no one died”; no government fell. Not surprisingly, then, for a number of not even especially conservative observers, ’68—and the sixties, more broadly—seemed to have been about a small minority of spoiled children playing revolution.<br>

  Abstract: Originally scheduled to take place in June 1967 but postponed because of the six-day War, the French president’s visit to Romania finally took place the following year, when, from May 14 to 18, de Gaulle was the guest of Nicolae Ceauşescu. It was a momentous time for France. During the visit, strikes and street violence escalated in Paris. News about developments on the home front reached the French delegation without interruption. For instance, in Craiova, a small provincial town in Romania, the French installed two special telephones and three fax machines. The worries of the French party would prove well-founded.<br>

  Abstract: The exercise of impetuosity, an instance of devastating and powerful force or an unjust and unwarranted display of physical intention for the purpose of intimidation, injury and destruction, are all aspects of violence, an elusive concept often applied in the description of a recognisable reality and an actual situation. Within the institutional confines and structures of a society, violence is roughly definable as “the illegal employment of methods of physical coercion”³ in the pursuit of individual and collective objectives. Étatist traditions are conterminal with the use of constitutionally sanctioned coercion⁴ in the defence and consolidation of state authority. All human<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, Vol. 1: Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa (Chicago, 1991), and Vol. 2: The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier (Chicago, 1997). 435 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne the emergence of capitalism. Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis. While he flies through the theoretical air with great speed in
   The Broken Whole, it is unclear whether the book can make any sort of stable or decisive landing.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78.

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

La visión totalizadora de Paz interpreta el evento como proveedor de respuestas a las cuestiones planteadas acerca de la nación enEl laberinto de la soledad, e insiste en la necesidad de reescribir la historia de México bajo el eje de una nueva genealogía. El libro de Poniatowska, en cambio, se rige por la fragmentación y la pluralidad, para transmitir las frecuentes voces disonantes de la sociedad civil. El análisis examina los modos en que la forma literaria representa relaciones entre la violencia, la justicia y la estética.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: A small section of the Goan elite sought political and civil rights and founded the Partido Indiano (Indian Party) in 1865 in the village of Orlim. It enjoyed mass support particularly of the local Catholics. The rival party was the pro-establishment Partido Ultramarino. The violence that ensued in Margao in 1890 during the municipal elections is known as the 21 September Revolt. It lasted for a mere 20 minutes though the military firing killed 12 persons on the spot besides injuring many more. Protest meetings were held not just in Goa but also in Bombay, Poona, Karachi and Zanzibar. Even the Canadian and American press condemned the brutality and carried news on the "Goa Revolution". This article brings out the history of that revolt in the context of the working of colonialism in Goa.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: This essay outlines an account of 'theological humanism' as a new form of theology of culture. I trace the connection between theological humanism and an ethics of responsibility dedicated to respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. I argue that without a 'theological' humanism we risk the reduction of values to human purposes, and yet without a theological 'humanism' religious conviction is unconstrained by moral purpose. In our age of religious violence and ecological crisis, what is needed in ethics is a renewed vision of the moral vocation of human beings not against but within the wider compass of life on earth.<br>

Abstract: Responding to the ethical and performative call of Judith Butler not to propagate the sex- and gender-related violence of the imbedded discourse that we study, this article inquires into the discursive strategies of Jewish scripture by analysing how it orchestrates certain norms of sex and gender and makes them serve the overall aim of securing cultural survival. Following this, it traces reflections on persons of ambiguous or indeterminate sex from rabbinic to modern Judaism so as to inquire into the rabbinic dependency on scripture when non-conforming individuals challenge its bipolar sex and gender system. Finally, the article considers if scripture, as suggested by Butler, can play a subversive role in how we attend to non-conforming others today. To do so, the author's distinction between hermeneutical and artifactual uses of scripture is presented to evaluate the extent to which modern Jews and non-Jews are able to influence their own representations of sex and gender and thus liberate themselves from the normativity implied by scriptural discourse.<br>

Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Abstract: The present article argues that Hélène Berr's Journal goes well beyond mere testimony to provide an astute analysis not only of the persecutory measures, arrests, camps, and deportations but also of the various attempts to camouflage the violence and even of the wider implications of what she ultimately recognized to be a systematic extermination. Hélène Berr thus presents an extraordinary case of a young French Jewish student at the Sorbonne who, steeped in literature but untrained in history, nevertheless achieved a degree of historical lucidity that, in view of the confused, limited, and often unreliable information available to her in Nazi-occupied Paris, we can only consider as remarkable. Above all, Hélène Berr's very personal confrontation with history, as it unfolded in all the sinister complexity of what we now know as the Holocaust, enables us to better understand these events in the human terms in which they were experienced and with the ethical dimensions that they take on for us today.<br>

Abstract: Ces réserves sont ponctuelles, en voici quelques exemples. Comme tout binôme, et il n'est pas
le seul dans le livre, le terme de contre-mémoire risque de produire l'impression d'opposition
mécanique ce qui n'est sûrement pas l'intention de l'auteure. Sur un autre registre, malgré tout
mon respect pour l'héritage intellectuel de Pierre Bourdieu, je ne suis pas convaincu par les efforts
de Christine Chivallon d'appliquer son appareil conceptuel à l'analyse du travail de la mémoire.
Puisque son érudition est très impressionnante, l'absence des travaux de Nathan Wachtel surprend
d'autant plus. L'Invention du quotidien de Michel de Certeau est citée, mais je n'ai trouvé aucune
mention de son concept opératoire de « propre », à mon avis très pertinent pour la démarche de
l'auteure. J'estime également que le concept de « lieu de mémoire » de Pierre Nora est trop rapidement
jugé inopérant pour sa recherche.<br>

tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: The 2001 disarmament of kamajor combatants in Bo, Sierra Leone was an event marked by violence. This paper considers that violence, and by extension other violent events in Sierra Leone's recent war, as narrative blocs: configurations of agency, time, imagery and articulation. This formulation stands in contrast to the way vionent events are often treated, as exceptional moments of outburst or eruption resulting from abnormal circumstances but meaningless in themselves. The paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork with the kamajor militia movement in Sierra Leone to trace some of these blocs both within the disarmament center and through other locations in the "war-scape" of Sierra Leone.<br>

Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to foster the regeneration and reorientation of peace research in the United States through its internationalization and radicalization. The authors locate the possible sources of this 'post-modern' redirection of American peace studies in the traditions of critical theory and phenomenology and in convergent work by contemporary West European scholars in Scandinavia and the Federal Republic of Germany. The main lines of this reorientation for American peace research are limned through an exploration of three substantive themes: power, violence, and hegemony; international society as totality; and the critical peace researcher as knower and actor.<br>

Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Abstract: In this article, a young man's narratives of violence are analysed, and a culturally shared storyline is identified as the basis of these narratives. It is argued that the stories are organized so as to construct a preferred self-presentation. One strategy to achieve this is to establish boundaries for what type of violence to use, whom to fight, where and for what reasons. I also argue that the narratives are structured to avoid being categorized as either victim or perpetrator, although both categories are drawn upon. Issues of masculinity are made relevant through categorization of the characters in the narrative, and positions are made available. Different masculine categories such as the hero/villain/non-man become relevant in the analysis. Different gendered positions are used in negotiating a masculine identity around narratives of and through telling about violence.<br>

Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: The violence that accompanied India's partition in 1947 was of such fiendishness that it has defied understanding. Fictional writings about this period express this bewilderment. They also portray pre-partition times of tolerance. The writers deal with the violence itself in different ways - redemptively, pessimistically or cynically. A survey.<br>

Abstract: Our political imaginations and the international arena are preoccupied with the inevitability of a clash of civilisations. While it is true that cultural and religious differences have precipitated violence, we have also witnessed a real dialogue of cultures. If conflicting economic interests and political concerns are taken to mean irreconcilable religious world views, ethnic cleansing and genocide will become the norm. We need a dialogue of culture as a prelude to a dialogue of religions, thus freeing us from the distrust of the Other.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>
