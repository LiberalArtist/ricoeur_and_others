  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

Journal Title: Critical Inquiry<br>
Article Title: Remembering the Historical Present<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522064<br>
Date: 03 2007<br>
Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Article Title: Northrop Frye and the Problem of Spiritual Authority<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219691<br>
Date: 10 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Barthes Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Speculative Philosophy<br>
Article Title: Introduction<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Steinbock Anthony<br>
Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>
