  Abstract: Michel Henry (1922–2002) was one of the early phenomenologists working in France, more or less contemporaneous with Emmanuel Lévinas and Paul Ricoeur. He is most well-known for developing a “material” phenomenology, or, as he later called it, a “phenomenology of the flesh.” Many of his early writings are heavily influenced by the philosophy of Karl Marx. Only his more recent (and final) writings are more explicitly religious.¹ Although some hints of these concerns are present in his earlier works (such as an analysis of Meister Eckhart’s mysticism in Section III of his major work
                  The Essence of Manifestation), they<br>

  Abstract: What Paul Ricoeur called the “hermeneutics of suspicion” has become the sine qua non of literary and cultural studies. Whether one thinks in terms of an unconscious, a superstructure, or a subtext, the analysis of intellectual and social phenomena begins from the assumption that things may not be what they seem, even where our most tangible intuitions and deeply held beliefs are concerned. From a methodological perspective, this has led to the emergence of what we might call “an archaeology of the presupposition.” An argument demonstrates its rigor by rendering its own aims and procedures as explicit and transparent as<br>

  Abstract: Analepsis and prolepsis are rough synonyms for flashback and flashforward. They were proposed by Gérard Genette as part of his theoretical and interpretive analysis of Marcel Proust’s
                  À la recherche du temps perdu, but they have since proved to be extremely valuable for thinking about the nature of narrative.¹ Observers of the “narrative turn,” the burgeoning interest across multiple disciplines in the explanatory power of stories, often explain its emergence by noting that narrative is, in the emphatic words of H. Porter Abbott, “the principal way in which our species organizes its understanding of time.”² Paul Ricoeur makes a similar<br>

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have raised the question of gift and recognition as a resource for the theology of nature and grace. Jean-Luc Marion’s careful analysis of the gift and the saturated phenomenon offers valuable insights while also making overtures to theology, but it falls short on some key points, particularly its denial of reciprocity and underdeveloped notion of recognition. Paul Ricoeur’s work, as I have explained, offers correctives to Marion’s by pairing a less-developed notion of gift with a stronger account of recognition and reciprocity. In the conclusion of the last chapter, I began to draw out how these<br>

  Abstract: What do Paul Ricoeur and Amartya Sen have to do with one another? On the surface, not much. Ricoeur is a French hermeneutic philosopher and theologian; Sen is a Nobel Prize–winning Indian economist. Ricoeur researches such topics as subjectivity, imagination, and memory; Sen, poverty, development, and famine. But beneath their surface differences lies a fundamental similarity in their respective projects. Both take the notion of human capability as the central descriptive and normative feature of human existence. For Ricoeur, the capable human being (

  Book Title: Liturgical Theology after Schmemann-An Orthodox Reading of Paul Ricoeur<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Louth Andrew<br>
  Abstract: While only rarely reflecting explicitly on liturgy, French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005) gave sustained attention to several themes pertinent to the interpretation of worship, including metaphor, narrative, subjectivity, and memory. Inspired by his well-known aphorism, "The symbol gives rise to thought," Liturgical Theology after Schmemann offers an original exploration of the symbolic world of the Byzantine Rite , culminating in a Ricoeurian analysis of its Theophany "Great Blessing of Water." .<br>

  Abstract: In the 1970s two well-known French philosophers clashed swords. Their
                  querelleconcerned the seemingly arcane issue of metaphoric reference. As we have seen, Paul Ricoeur argues convincingly inLa Métaphore vivethat metaphor is a cognitive tool, that it helps in certain circumstances to articulate our experience of the world. Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: It is not clear from this quote why the range of Ricoeur’s contribution is overlooked. As Budd [
         3] points out, we should not presuppose a structural analysis, for this presupposition, identified with the mathematical physics approach considered above, reduces our options for action. However, this is not all that Ricoeur [14] has to say. Yes, we must critique his work, but if we limit ourselves to this operation, we miss the possibilities that open up and, hence, are poorer. Words are part of sentences, but much more can be said about this in relation to the process of making meaning. Similarly, sentences are parts of narratives, but, again, more can be said about this. These are levels in a hierarchy of action, which is the process of semantic innovation. Arguably, “library” also belongs in this process as an achievement of and contributor to this hierarchy.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur has placed the most interesting discussion of this second chapter at the very end. This is where he skillfully introduces Sen’s seminal work on capabilities and explores the ties between Sen and Taylor. The capabilities approach brings forth a set of social goods which are considered crucial for individual self‐development. In that vein, Taylor proposes an analysis of social goods which may contribute to the capabilities approach. Ricoeur pinpoints this contribution in the “evaluative framework” developed by Taylor: “This [Sen’s] concept of an ‘evaluation of situation’ is close to that of the ‘strong evaluations’ which for Charles Taylor conjoin self‐assertion and an ethical position expressed in terms of the good rather than of obligation” (144). Indeed, a fundamental question at the heart of the capabilities approach is that of the good life: according to this approach, economic agents are driven by the answer to the question “How should I live?” in the form of effective opportunities.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: Ricoeur's "Symbolism of Evil" and Cross-Cultural Comparison: The Representation of Evil in Maya Indian Culture<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies. As soon, however, as the gift loses this special capacity to express recognition, the mutual recognition of donor and recipient will be lost.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>

Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: This article critically assesses Bell's attempt at transforming discourse analysis into discourse interpretation by means of hermeneutics as developed by Paul Ricoeur. If a hermeneutic turn is to take place in a discipline that proceeds according to the principles of empirical research, cognitive hermeneutics is the better option compared to Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Part I presents a short introduction to cognitive hermeneutics as developed by Tepe. Against this background, some central theses of Ricoeur's hermeneutics, on which Bell's approach is based, are discussed in part II.<br>

Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the

Abstract: Other thinkers have also been instrumental in re-inteφreting philosophy as a way of re-

Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

Issue: e24805687<br>
Date: June 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Mason Garth<br>
Abstract: In this article I examine Philip Qipa (P.Q.) Vundla’s Moral Rearmament-inspired (MRA) politics with a view to explicating the previously hidden currents at work in his political activism. In my analysis, I draw on the theoretical frameworks of Paul Ricoeur and Homi Bhabha. In terms of these conceptual foundations, I investigate Vundla’s involvement in two foundational events in the history of the South African struggle, namely the school boycott of 1955 and the bus boycott of 1957. The official history of these two events, written by social historians such as Tom Lodge, interprets them as the dawn of mass opposition against apartheid. However, I contend that a closer analysis of these two events via biographical material reveals a more complex history, implicitly connected to the person of P.Q. Vundla and his politics of negotiation and finding common ground between opposing ideologies. Vundla stands out within this context because he was a nonconforming ANC leader, who disagreed with the way the party leadership approached political activism. His approach was driven by MRA values, which sought political solutions through dialogue and aimed to benefit all communities within South Africa. Vundla can be seen as an early forerunner of the bridge-building politics of Nelson Mandela. It is hoped that, by examining the role of MRA values in Vundla’s activism, a fuller, more complex account of politics in the 1950s can be arrived at.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Author(s): Clegg Stewart R.<br>
Abstract: Although studies in organizational storytelling have dealt extensively with the relationship between narrative, power and organizational change, little attention has been paid to the implications of this for ethics within organizations. This article addresses this by presenting an analysis of narrative and ethics as it relates to the practice of organizational downsizing. Drawing on Paul Ricoeur's theories of narrative and ethics, we analyze stories of organizational change reported by employees and managers in an organization that had undergone persistent downsizing. Our analysis maintains that the presence of a dominant story that seeks to legitimate organizational change also serves to normalize it, and that this, in turn, diminishes the capacity for organizations to scrutinize the ethics of their actions. We argue that when organizational change narratives become singularized through dominant forms of emplotment, ethical deliberation and responsibility in organizations are diminished. More generally, we contend that the narrative closure achieved by the presence of a dominant narrative amongst employees undergoing organizational change is antithetical to the openness required for ethical questioning.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: La présente étude se consacre à un examen du concept de la mémoire collective en s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation que Paul Ricœur propose de ce concept dans son ouvrage La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. L'auteur présente une lecture critique de l'interprétation de la mémoire collective chez Ricœur là ou Ricœur tente de comprendre ce phénomène par analogie avec la mémoire personnelle et risque, selon cette lecture, d'occulter les dimensions de la mémoire collective qui échappent à un tel rapport analogique. L'auteur tente alors de dépasser le cadre de cette analogie par une analyse des sources symboliques et métapersonnelles de la mémoire collective. This study examines the concept of collective memory through an investigation of Paul Ricœur's interpretation of this concept in his work, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. In presenting a critical reading of the analogy Ricoeur establishes between collective and personal memory, the author argues that this analogy risks excluding those dimensions of collective memory which cannot be comprehended through such an analogy. The attempt is then made to surmount this difficulty through an analysis of collective memory in relation to its symbolic and metapersonal sources.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Shenk Gary<br>
Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Author(s): Barthes Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219783<br>
Date: 1 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Webber John S.<br>
Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the literary genre of the written Hasidic homilies of Rabbi Aryeh Leib Alter (1848-1905), known as
         Sfat Emet. The discussion is conducted through the lens of Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “the work of the text.” This concept encompasses the elements of composition and codification of the text as well as the desired effects of the reading process. The analysis identifies the features that are at work in the homilies, along with the type of hermeneutic activity into which the reader is drawn. This activity is designed to cause the reader to become open, in new or renewed ways, toward various dimensions of reality. The article suggests that the Hasidic homily is designed to act upon the reader in and through the very reading process: what the reader learns is not confined to the content of the homily but is first and foremost due to the nature of the reading experience itself.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: This example, albeit brief, already provides an important clue about the locus of the connection between Deleuze and phenomenology. For the above contrast could equally be characterized in terms of the difference between a static and a genetic phenomenology. Deleuze's transcendental empiricism, in other words, bears some resemblance to Husserl's description of the passive syntheses (temporality, habit, etc.) that precede and condition the active syntheses performed by intentional acts of consciousness. From this perspective, we can see both thinkers as inquiring into what precedes and gives rise to the meaning-formations established within a static analysis of intentional consciousness. By all accounts, Deleuze was unaware of Husserl's genetic phenomenology. But if he were, one could easily imagine that he would have been more receptive to phenomenology. And likewise, when Husserlians become aware of the new directions developed in Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, my sense is that they too will come to embrace Deleuzian insights as possible extensions of genetic phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: Tragic optimism is an oxymoron entirely consonant with Shaw's customary mode of analysis: dialectical (both/and) thinking. Shaw was well aware that the historical record revealed precious little to demonstrate that humankind had made substantive progress in reducing unwarranted pain, suffering, and injustice. As his urbane Devil so eloquently puts it in
         Man and Superman, if the race excels at one particular thing it is in perfecting ever more efficient means of wreaking destruction on a massive scale and not in honing the executive skills necessary for peacefully achieving the humane society. Moreover, without a vibrant socialism to vitiate the dark side of capitalism, an eventuality that with every passing day seemed to him more and more remote, Shaw saw few if any signs that the desperate conditions of the victimized, whose numbers were growing at an alarming rate, were likely to improve. Even his flirtations with the ruling dictators of the period failed to produce the consummation he devoutly desired. In the main, humans generally struck him as simply too immature, selfish, and shortsighted to manage their affairs wisely. Hence, it is not surprising that the Shavian corpus, for all its sparkling wit and polemical precision, includes a palpable strain of simmering pessimism. At the same time, however, Shaw was not one iota less optimistic that life, in strictly biological terms, would continue to evolve unabated, one species supplanting another through the eons. As Lilith—Shaw's embodiment of the Life Force—declares in her statement that concludesBack to Methuselah, “Of life only is there no end.”
               Barring a cataclysm of biblical proportions, Shaw believed that life was indestructible. Therefore, to his way of thinking, the best use of human energy and talent lies in doing everything possible to assist the forward movement of evolution as it wends its way through the generations. In the Shavian universe, the operative principle is that livi~<br>
