  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

Abstract: In fact, it is this very confrontation between the claims of the collective singular, initiated by the expansion of capital (and its proxy, the nation‐state), and received special histories lived by peoples encountered along its route that brings into the immanent time of modernity the forceful contact of a history that has its own unique, internal time with countries like Japan and the colonized world outside of Euro‐America. The opening up of the globe and especially the creation of a world market often brought diverse cultures into violent clash in a synchronous drama that inevitably was recoded in a diachronic narrative upholding a chronologically uniform time ranging from barbaric to civilized and insisting on authorizing discrete comparisons. While it was in the context of this expanding world market that forms of unevenness were first perceived—then later described as noncontemporaneous contemporaneity—it was undoubtedly Marx who first called attention to the uneven development of material production and the coexistence of a dominant mode of production and surviving prior modes that often appear in “stunted form, or even travestied,” which thus “assign rank and influence to the others.”
         17And it is this contest between these prior modes of production and a universalizing world history (personified by the world market) appointed to unify and incorporate the plural special histories that is subsequently put into play by discussions in prewar Japan and elsewhere throughout the colonized and semicolonized worlds of the interwar period. Capital’s desire to reduce this plurality to a singular space of experience undermines itself because the space already bears the mark of difference, owing to its association with the nation‐state. But to say this is not to invite the possibility of an alternative modernity. As Ricoeur observed: “The paradox is great: history is proclaimed to be a world phenomenon by historian‐patriots” (MHF,p. 301). But what Ricoeur insis~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Journal Title: Ethical Theory and Moral Practice<br>

Abstract: At least since Aristotle, phronesis (practical wisdom) and poetics (making or creating) have been understood as essentially different activities, one moral the other (in itself) non-moral. Today, if anything, this distinction is sharpened by a Romantic association of poetics with inner subjective expression. Recent revivals of Aristotelian ethics sometimes allow for poetic dimensions of ethics, but these are still separated from practical wisdom per se. Through a fresh reading of phronesis in the French hermeneutical phenomenologist Paul Ricoeur, I argue that phronesis should be viewed as at least in part poetic at its very core. That is, phronesis deals with the fundamentally tragic human situation of moral incommensurability, and it responds to this by making or creating new moral meaning. Such a poetics of practical wisdom helps phronesis stand up to significant and important critiques made of it by a range of modernists and post-modernists, pointing a way forward for some important contemporary moral debates.<br>

Abstract: Tal discusión se encuentra de nuevo en Andrew Abbott, ibid., ps. 226-230. La section espe-
cial dedicada a la cuestión por Social Science History (vol. 16, números 3 y 4 de 1992), la revis-
ta oficial de la Social Science History Association, introducida por William H. Sewell, Jr., contó
con artículos de gente tan significativa como George Steinmetz, Mary Jo Maynes, Margaret R.
Somers, Janet Hart y Luisa Passerini. Un argumento provocador y claramente favorable a la
narración lo defiende Alan Megill en "Recounting the Past: Description, Explanation and
Narrative in Historiography", The American Historical Review, 94, 3 (1989), ps. 627-653 (tra-
ducción en Historia Social, 16, 1993). Tratamientos más amplios del tema se encuentran,
como se sabe, en Paul Ricoeur, Tiempoy narración. Configuratión del tiempo en el re lato
histórico, Ediciones Cristiandad, Madrid, 1987 y en Hayden White, The Content of the Form.

Abstract: I want to thank the organizers for allowing us to go back to those halcyon days of yore when we were young, the world was ours, and we, the carriers of the coals, were unintentionally about to bring critical theory to the United States. No doubt I played a minor role in that process, and looking back there was no singular event that led to my association with critical theory but, rather, a curious set of happenings that led to encounters, friendships, and a richness of life that I could not have fathomed when I made a simple trip to Germany in 1971. At the time I considered myself to be a thoroughgoing phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. I had written my first book on Paul Ricoeur and was hired to teach philosophy of religion, having had the good fortune of having been a student directly of Mircea Eliade and indirectly of Paul Ricoeur. No doubt I would still be teaching and writing about the philosophy of religion had it not been for the events of the day. America was “all shook up” with the opposition to the Vietnam War, the dilemma of the draft and the reaction to it on college campuses, Kent State, the invasion of Cambodia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and numerous other incidents. True, I had no particular qualifications to deal with those things; none of us did. But I was prone to try. I was equipped by sentiment if not by intellect.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>
