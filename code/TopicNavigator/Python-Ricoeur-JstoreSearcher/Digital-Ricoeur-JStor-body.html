  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: The Heart Has Its Reasons-Towards a Theological Anthropology of the Heart<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tóth Beáta<br>
  Abstract: This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: A serious objection against the concept of autonomy is that it does not allow for the polarity between activity and passivity that controls human life every moment of the day, and that this concept permits only an activist anthropology that conflicts with the contingency, vulnerability, fragility, and finitude of human life. Does this concept of autonomy really not allow for the three forms of passivity that Ricoeur identified—the passivity that my body imposes on me, the passivity inherent in our mutual recognition of each other, and the passivity that provides the soil in which the seed of the voice of conscience lodges?
            27In my view autonomy and passivity are not necessarily mutually exclusive, for why can people not handle these forms of passivity autonomously? Why can they not accept the transience of physical life with dignity? Why can they not consort with a beloved with dignity, when the supreme form of loving lies in being loved? And why can they not be a sounding board for the voice of conscience with dignity? Finally, why should their autonomy conflict with their creaturely relation to God, since autonomy is in fact implicit in creation, as Georg Essen rightly puts it?28<br>

Abstract: There is a good body of work in recent French philosophy on the issue of recognition. Emmanuel Renault, Christian Lazerri, and the antiutilitarian MAUSS (Mouvement anti‐utilitariste en sciences sociales) come readily to mind. Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor are influential, but so, too, are Bourdieu and other French sociologists. In spite of the original contributions of these French authors, none of their work has been made available to English readers to date. A first step toward filling this lack has been made with this translation of the final opus of the recently deceased Paul Ricoeur on the theme of recognition.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: This interesting work presents fragments and traces from geological and archaeological practices in nineteenth-century Britain and considers their connections with and influence on Victorian literature.
      Excavating Victoriansis not exactly history of science but, rather, a work of literary criticism that draws very heavily on the history of science. Virginia Zimmerman underscores the disjunction between scientific and literary writing as an artifact of our view from the twenty-first century, drawing on Gillian Beer'sDarwin's Plots(Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1983) for useful context and analysis. She identifies the writings of Charles Lyell and Charles Dickens, along with those of their contemporaries, as part of a single body of literature, written in response to the newly discovered vastness of time and to emphasize the authority of the individual to interpret (and thus reclaim) the past. Zimmerman uses the notion of the “trace,” as defined by Paul Ricoeur, to indicate “an object's origin in the past but also its duration into the present” (p. 8); the strategies the Victorians used to cope with this confused temporality is the major resonating theme, along with the continual conjunction of construction and destruction. This juxtaposition of preservation and decay is emphasized throughout: in geology, with the fossil remains of long-extinct species; in archaeology, with the action of Vesuvius that at once destroyed Pompeii and forever preserved its remains (which would otherwise have been lost); and in Victorian London, with the continual building projects that uncovered the traces of Roman occupation.<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Abstract: Mimesis
         2constitutes what Ricoeur calls the “pivot” of his analysis inTime and Narrative. By describing mimesis2in this way, Ricoeur emphasizes its mediating function: in order for a narrative prefigured in mimesis1to be refigured by a reader in mimesis3, it must undergo a kind of alchemy that recuperates the same old stories of public opinion into potentially new stories about the possibilities of future action. In order to generate such possibilities—to enter the “kingdom of theas if,” as Ricoeur puts it—a narrative must be configured for optimal translation. This configuration phase features an “interplay of innovation and sedimentation” that ensures that the resulting narrative will not simply be a reproduction of the culture in which it was constructed but rather a singular work that presents resources for future action, whether literary or political (1984, 1:64–69). If the prefiguration of mimesis1highlights the similarities among historical narratives shaped by the same cultural context and historical subject, then the configuration of mimesis2highlights the remarkable variety within this same body of texts. Or, to focus on the significant agent, mimesis1prefigures the field of action in which the historical agent exists, whereas mimesis2features the configuring choices, self-conscious and otherwise, of the agent who writes, revises, or otherwise re-presents history.<br>

Abstract: In the face of this chilling assessment, Shaw reached the only conclusion that made logical sense to him: life's invincibility, the core of Lilith's claim, “heralds a victory for evolution that is fully compatible with a defeat for mankind.”
         
               However distressing it may be to contemplate in the abstract, the conjunction of evolution's victory and mankind's defeat comported perfectly with his tragic consciousness. Beneath the antic pose he often presented sardonically to an all-too-credulous public, Shaw harbored the corrosive awareness that we mortals may never be able to synthesize the dualities that inescapably circumscribe the human condition—thought and deed, wisdom and power, body and spirit—in a way that both ensures the survival of the race and enhances the plight of the downtrodden. For Shaw, at his nadir, the issue was not that we lack individuals with the requisite qualities to meet developmental imperatives. We do not; the Life Force fills this need, everlastingly. Of more concern to him was the inescapable fact that gifted visionaries never seem to gain sufficient traction to alter the downward spiral of events decisively, once and for all. Either they are ignored altogether by an otherwise engaged multitude or the presiding authorities devise ever more diabolical means of neutering them or their accomplishments. Winter, spring, summer, or fall, they are always unwelcome.24
            
               As time marched on, the marriage of contraries Shaw longed to effect seemed less and less achievable, and this growing anxiety was reflected not just in his plays but in his prose writings as well. Bleakness enveloped him at every turn, with no reprieve in sight. In his considered judgment, if humankind was a hair's breadth away from dissolution, and this certainly seemed to be the case in his eyes, it is because we are our own worst enemy. If the species is irretrievably lost, Shaw concludes, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fr~<br>

Journal Title: Science Fiction Studies<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
