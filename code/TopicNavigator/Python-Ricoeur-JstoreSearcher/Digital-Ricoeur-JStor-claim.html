  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Abstract: Having recalled the fact of an uncritical but constant claim that the Spirit
                  of Godis at work in us and in the world, I have highlighted the main difficulties to which this claim gives rise. This sequence is well known to believers: after a time of peaceful possession of the faith, they become aware of challenges to it. If not doubt, at least an ongoing questioning—what St. Thomas called thecogitatio—is a part of the faith. It is the passport into what Paul Ricoeur calls the second naiveté,¹ which is more or less the state of a<br>

  Abstract: How do mobile media technologies shape identities? Identity – what it is to be and have a self, and to belong to social and cultural groups – is always mediated. People understand themselves, others and their world in terms of the media they know and use. According to philosopher Paul Ricoeur, narrative is the privileged medium for self-understanding and social/cultural identifications.¹ The quick and widespread adoption of mobile media technologies prompts us to revisit this claim. In this window I look at the context of Jakarta, Indonesia, to show how urban mobile media practices shape identities in playful ways.<br>

  Author(s) PATTISON GEORGE<br>
  Abstract: Over the past several decades narrative accounts of personal identity have become increasingly popular (see, e.g. Davenport 2012, MacIntyre 1984, Ricoeur 1992, Rudd 2012, Schechtman 1996, Taylor 1989). As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Practical and Normative Ethics for Librarianship<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Over time, statements such as the LBR have been discussed and alternatives weighed, but librarianship’s discursive practice has, in recent years, largely constituted an orthodoxy that may not be sensitive or responsive to disputation. One voice of this orthodoxy is Robert Hauptman, who writes, “We are free to articulate anything we imagine” [
         30, p. 18], and “If there are more fundamental rights than freedom of thought, then anyone, naturally, can cite those rights when attempting to control what students may read in a class, what libraries may collect, and what Americans may access on the Internet” [30, p. 138]. His first idea is incorrect; there are, in fact, laws that limit what a person can say. Paradoxically, Hauptman also argues against research misconduct on the grounds of responsibility and public interest, but if we are indeed free to say anything we can imagine, we can lie and falsify with impunity. The positive ethos of research integrity is indisputable; violation of the ethos can cause harm. That positive ethos does, however, come into conflict with Hauptman’s first maxim. His second claim is puzzling; if there are more fundamental rights, then those rights probably should supersede a right to access to information. For example, a right to privacy trumps another’s “right” to certain of an individual’s personal information. A right to freedom from harm trumps a person’s “right” to libel another intentionally and with malice. Hauptman also proposes that, in combating censorship, the minority cannot dictate to the majority. However, Paul Ricoeur, arguing for the kind of normative ethics suggested here, says, “Whoever might be a victim must not be sacrificed to the benefit of some common good. This is the anti‐utilitarian point of the Rawlsian theory of justice” [31, p. 65]. It is obvious that the whims of the minority should not hold sway simply because they wish it to be so, but, likewise, the majority should not be able to cause harm to others o~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522064<br>
Date: 03 2007<br>
Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: The central claim is that religious narratives shape sociopolitical positions, a commonplace observation that Gutterman embellishes by asserting “that this religiosity often takes on a prophetic cast” (p. 49). Such assertions, however, are also quite common in studies of American religion and politics (think of Perry Miller, Robert Bellah, and Sacvan Bercovitch) and they would benefit from a more precise articulation of the relation between religion and politics. While he adroitly ranges over political material (especially in his insightful use of Hannah Arendt and Paul Ricoeur), Gutterman's grasp of other subjects is sometimes shaky. He claims that his approach displaces “the common view of the status of religion in American political culture” (p. 3), yet the two conventional methods he names—jurisprudential/Constitutional or policy‐oriented studies—scantly exemplify the range of understandings in either the academy or public life. Gutterman cites Alexis de Tocqueville as exemplifying a distinct “third mode of scholarship” (p. 3) that, in contrast to “a functional approach to American religiosity” (p. 8), underscores the importance of religion in American culture. Such functionalism may dominate political science, but this is far from the case in religious studies, history, or American studies, where the significance of religion is a given.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: rh.2006.24.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Date: 8 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: In Time, Narrative, and History, David Carr argues against the narrativist claim that our lived experience does not possess the formal attributes of a story; this conclusion can be reinforced from a semiotic perspective. Our experience is mediated through temporal signs that are used again in the construction of stories. Since signs are social entities from the start, this approach avoids a problem of individualism specific to phenomenology, one which Carr takes care to resolve. A semiotic framework is also explicit about a theme Carr handles implicitly: the status of representation. Representation is internal to signification, mediating our experience not just retrospectively but prospectively in the planning and execution of action. A model is presented in which the temporal organization of experience and action is formally coordinated with the temporal organization of narrative. The model is then applied to a historical event: John Batman's attempt in 1835 to purchase land from some Aboriginal tribes around what is now Melbourne. The meaning of this event is not located only in historical writing about it but in the semiotic constitution of the event itself. Changes of meaning emerge from relations between events as new events-in this case the Australian High Court's Mabo decision-align with old ones. Finally, a number of contrasts are indicated between this model and proposals made by Arthur C. Danto, Hayden White, F. R. Ankersmit, Fernand Braudel, and Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Inspired by Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis' claim in 1798 that physicians might learn forms of medical reasoning from les anciens rhéteurs, in this paper I explore intimate associations between medicine and rhetoric over the longue durée. Gravely susceptible to error, medical reasoning relies on signs and examples, both gleaned from experience and both the subject of rhetorical inquiry; like rhetoric, medicine reaches plausible conclusions from probable premises. Here, ranging from Hippocrates and Plato through Aristotle to early modern England, I argue that forms of inference developed and refined in the history of rhetoric offer ancient and early modern philosophers and physicians models and metaphors for their own forays into the probable.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Abstract: In this paper some claims of Professor Ricoeur are challenged. (1) It is pointed out on historical grounds that counter to Professor Ricoeur's claim, most past philosophies are displaced, or ignored. The surviving canon is small and very selective. There is, therefore, substantial agreement on the large corpus which is rejected. (2) It is also argued that Professor Ricoeur's contrast between philosophy and the sciences is too sharp since in the history of modern sciences there are always conflicting theories existing in parallel. However, it is the case that in philosophy standards of "acceptability" are looser and not the rigorous ones of science. A philosophical theory may be appreciated for the problems it discloses, the richness and subtlety of its arguments, its strategies and the like despite acknowledged failings. Appreciation of incompatible theories is not irrational. (3) The claim is rejected that the seeming irrationality is resolved by viewing each system as wholly autonomous. (4) The apparent restriction of philosophy by Professor Ricoeur to global systems is also questioned. L'auteur conteste quelques affirmations du prof. Ricoeur. (1) Elle montre, sur des bases historiques, que beaucoup de philosophies passées sont écartées ou ignorées. Le canon retenu est petit et très sélectif. Il y a donc un accord substantiel quant au vaste corpus qui est rejeté. (2) Elle montre aussi que le contraste que le professeur Ricoeur établit entre philosophie et sciences est trop abrupt, puisqu'il y a toujours eu, dans l'histoire de la science moderne, des théories opposées qui coexistaient. Toutefois, il est vrai qu'en philosophie, les standards d' «acceptabilité» sont plus lâches et diffèrent de ceux, plus rigoureux, de la science. Une philosophie peut être appréciée pour les problèmes qu'elle pose, pour la richesse et la subtilité de ses arguments, ses stratégies ou d'autres choses semblables et ceci en dépit de ses insuffisances notoires. Il n'est pas irrationnel d'a~<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: First of all, it might come as some surprise—not only for Janicaud but equally for Ricoeur scholars—to note that in a 2003 interview, Ricoeur mentions Deleuze as one of “the two thinkers” whom he “most admired.”
         
               There is little evidence in Ricoeur's writings that would actually support this claim, since Deleuze is hardly even mentioned by him and is never engaged in any sustained manner. Nonetheless, Ricoeur's remark does suggest that he would embrace the endeavor to bring Deleuze's work into dialogue with phenomenology, though I do not think that he would believe that such a dialogue could take place without the work of hermeneutics.21<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: In the face of this chilling assessment, Shaw reached the only conclusion that made logical sense to him: life's invincibility, the core of Lilith's claim, “heralds a victory for evolution that is fully compatible with a defeat for mankind.”
         
               However distressing it may be to contemplate in the abstract, the conjunction of evolution's victory and mankind's defeat comported perfectly with his tragic consciousness. Beneath the antic pose he often presented sardonically to an all-too-credulous public, Shaw harbored the corrosive awareness that we mortals may never be able to synthesize the dualities that inescapably circumscribe the human condition—thought and deed, wisdom and power, body and spirit—in a way that both ensures the survival of the race and enhances the plight of the downtrodden. For Shaw, at his nadir, the issue was not that we lack individuals with the requisite qualities to meet developmental imperatives. We do not; the Life Force fills this need, everlastingly. Of more concern to him was the inescapable fact that gifted visionaries never seem to gain sufficient traction to alter the downward spiral of events decisively, once and for all. Either they are ignored altogether by an otherwise engaged multitude or the presiding authorities devise ever more diabolical means of neutering them or their accomplishments. Winter, spring, summer, or fall, they are always unwelcome.24
            
               As time marched on, the marriage of contraries Shaw longed to effect seemed less and less achievable, and this growing anxiety was reflected not just in his plays but in his prose writings as well. Bleakness enveloped him at every turn, with no reprieve in sight. In his considered judgment, if humankind was a hair's breadth away from dissolution, and this certainly seemed to be the case in his eyes, it is because we are our own worst enemy. If the species is irretrievably lost, Shaw concludes, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fr~<br>
