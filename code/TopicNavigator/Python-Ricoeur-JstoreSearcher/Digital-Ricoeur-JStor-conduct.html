  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

Author(s): van der Ven Johannes A.<br>
Abstract: How does one conduct such discussions and evaluations of selected differences in perspective coordination? I believe that the figure of an imaginary judge offers a solution, thus applying to interreligious dialogue an insight developed by Ricoeur in the field of historical research.
            52In a nutshell: to avoid partiality in such dialogue one requires an imaginary judge, who functions in the dialogue partners’ minds as a kind of regulatory principle of impartiality. He guides—in the partners’ imagination—the discussion and evaluation of the aforementioned selected differences.<br>

Article Title: “History and Tragedy.”<br>
Publisher: Harper and Row<br>
Issue: intelitestud.16.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 9 1, 1971<br>
Author(s): Eze Chielozona<br>
Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Furthermore, children come to us fully immersed in “divine mystery,” Shaw observes. They have a “conscience,” which is nothing other than the inborn urge to prefer the good over the bad and the right over the wrong.
         
               From the moment they make their entrance, Shaw maintains, humans naturally lean toward the commendable. For this reason, in the Shavian universe of enlightened child rearing, totalitarian haranguing from pious elders about proper conduct is both unnecessary and undesirable. To be sure, the young need appropriate nurturing in order to acquire a foundational moral code they can subsequently amend as they mature. Youths do have to be socialized developmentally; they do need to be grounded in the ways of civilized life. Otherwise, the transition to adulthood may prove difficult for them. No one denies this, including Shaw. But, he insists, youngsters come into the world with all the equipment they need to pursue rectitude. Hence, they should not be prisoners in their homes, their schools, or their places of worship. Instead, we should spare them the reign of terror that traditionally accompanies childhood by creatively harnessing their innate tendency toward the worthy. So Shaw asserts.41<br>
