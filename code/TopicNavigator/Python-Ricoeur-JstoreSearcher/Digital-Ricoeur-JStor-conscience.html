  Abstract: In a world where justice appears to be the most one can ask for, there is no room for forgiveness and much space for the particular cruelties practiced in the name of the war against wickedness. Significantly, those who stress justice often turn it most harshly upon themselves. According to Paul Ricoeur in

In the earliest stage, the force that punished the guilty lay outside men. Once conscience became consciousness,<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: The representation of history continues to evolve in the domain of museum exhibitions. This evolution is informed in part by the creation of new display methods-many of which depart from the traditional conventions used to achieve the "museum effect"-in part by an increased attention to the museum-visitor relationship. In this context the ethical force of bearing witness, at times a crucial aspect of the museum experience, has emerged as a particularly compelling issue. In seeking to represent and address atrocity, injustice, and the abrogation of human rights, museums have the potential to become "sites of conscience" and to encourage "historical consciousness." Through a series of three exhibitions devoted to slavery, the New-York Historical Society demonstrated how such sites can be constructed and how objects can be deployed to represent extreme or "limit cases." In this review/essay I investigate and interrogate these exhibitions, looking closely at the use of objects as a source of "indirect testimony" (Marc Bloch) and at the "dialogical situation" (Paul Ricoeur) that might arise in an encounter among objects, exhibit narratives, and visitors. Thinking in terms of point of view, I look at the variety of rhetorical platforms from which objects speak in these exhibitions; thinking in terms of syntax, I look at the effects of ordering and of the radical juxtaposition of objects; thinking in terms of irony, I look at the provocations of double-voiced narratives and at how objects are used to support those historical sentences.<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, children come to us fully immersed in “divine mystery,” Shaw observes. They have a “conscience,” which is nothing other than the inborn urge to prefer the good over the bad and the right over the wrong.
         
               From the moment they make their entrance, Shaw maintains, humans naturally lean toward the commendable. For this reason, in the Shavian universe of enlightened child rearing, totalitarian haranguing from pious elders about proper conduct is both unnecessary and undesirable. To be sure, the young need appropriate nurturing in order to acquire a foundational moral code they can subsequently amend as they mature. Youths do have to be socialized developmentally; they do need to be grounded in the ways of civilized life. Otherwise, the transition to adulthood may prove difficult for them. No one denies this, including Shaw. But, he insists, youngsters come into the world with all the equipment they need to pursue rectitude. Hence, they should not be prisoners in their homes, their schools, or their places of worship. Instead, we should spare them the reign of terror that traditionally accompanies childhood by creatively harnessing their innate tendency toward the worthy. So Shaw asserts.41<br>
