Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>

Abstract: Webb identifies hyperbole as operating within the thought of a number of philosophers and writers, including William James, Friedrich Nietzsche, Søren Kierkegaard, Georges Bataille, Flannery O'Connor, G. K. Chesterton, and Karl Barth (1993a, 1993b, 1995).
         
               As a theologian, Webb also views certain theological concepts such as charity, grace, ethics, the gift, and love as hyperbolic (1996, 2000). He suggests, and I agree with him, that religious language and the project of theology itself are hyperbolic—for example, the assertion of Christ's divinity is hyperbolic, and “the eschatological imagination is a dramatic exaggeration of the basic human desire for satisfaction and harmony” (1999, 13). Hyperbole is not simply a ridiculous utterance that is easily dismissed. What Ricoeur and Webb each confirm is that hyperbole is a mode of thought and a practice of excess that can reveal theo-philosophical insight and express what cannot be expressed in any other way. It is a play with extremity at the boundaries of reason and rationality whereby logical thought forms are opened up to radical perspectival expressions; it is a “consent to a perspective from which certain views would not otherwise exist” (Webb4
            1993a, 20). Identifying or adopting a hyperbolic perspective, however, is more than a theoretical mode of thought, just as it is more than a simple and obvious trope.<br>
