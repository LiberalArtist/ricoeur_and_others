  A Tupiniquim Response from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gk0831">Psychoanalytic Mediations between Marxist and Postcolonial Readings of the Bible</a><br>
  Author(s) Silva Fernando Candido da<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis may be viewed (following suggestions by Paul Ricoeur [1970] in
                     Freud and Philosophy) as a hermeneutics, specifically as a hermeneutics of desire. it traces or tracks the imprint of desire first in the dream and then in a variety of behavioral symptoms (jokes, slips of the tongue, as well as bodily symptoms). This hermeneutics is, however, never simple since desire is constitutionally conflicted, divided, deflected, and disguised. Thus desire is never only or primarily what it seems. it is constitutionally enigmatic. it is this that necessitates something like a science of desire, an analytics of desire.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The organization of lectures in
      The Justfollows Ricoeur’s earlier book,Oneself as Another(trans. Kathleen Blamey [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992]) and reflects the dimensions of what he calls the moral constitution of action. He understands this constitution in terms of a horizontal and vertical axis. The horizontal axis embeds the individual in both face‐to‐face interactions with others and more distanced interactions mediated by institutions. The vertical axis involves different levels of analysis that indicate the place, for Ricoeur, of both teleological and deontological theories of justice as well as of references to practical reason. Moral action has a teleological dimension, he thinks, insofar as it is rooted in the human desire for personal fulfillment and friendship within just institutions. His lectures suggest that it is this dimension that grounds the bonds of political community. But moral action possesses a deontological dimension as well because the impartiality necessary to just institutions requires a procedural account of justice. Finally, moral action involves an element of practical reason in the moment at which the subject must judge and act in one way or another.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question <br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” <br>

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: "Like a house's balcony, I overlook whatever I desire." At first glance, this line by the late Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish may not seem to bear multiple or complex meanings. A daring attempt at interpretation, however, can show that this simple metaphor is capable of bearing and provoking various philosophical ideas. To achieve this end, the interpretation invites the ideas of several theorists of metaphor and imagery, including Bachelard, Derrida, Heidegger, Ricoeur, Nietzsche, and Deleuze, in approaching Darwish. «أطل كشرفة بيت، على ما أريد ». للوهلة الأولى، لا يبدو هذا السطر الشعري للشاعر الفلسطيني الراحل محمود درويش قابلاً لأن يحمل معاني متعددة أومعقدة. على أن محاولة أكثر جراة في التأويل قد تظهر أن تلك الاستعارة البسيطة قادرة على استفزاز أفكار فلسفية عديدة. ومن أجل الوصول إلى تلك الغاية، فإن التأويل الذي تقوم عليه هذه المقالة يستدعي أفكاراً لمنظرين متنوعين حول الاستعارة والصورة، بمن فيهم باشلار وهيديجر وريكور ونيتشه ودولوز .<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort <br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical theory remains rooted in a metaphysics of the "interiority of meaning". For example, Ricoeur transposed Freud's metaphysics of interior libidinal meaning into a literary theory of interpretation. The corollary to Freud's metaphysics of interiorized meaning is "desire as lack". Deleuze and Guattari's attack on Freud's theory of historical-libidinal drives formed the basis of their explication of the "rhizomatic" exteriority of meaning, which they develop, in literary terms, in their book, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In their view, Kafka's novels model a style of writing that disavows interior meaning. They also oppose the primacy of Freud's concept of desire-as-lack with that of desire-as-plenitude. This paper will discuss a mode of biblical interpretation based on the twin concepts of exteriority of meaning and desire-as-plentitude, according to four interpretive stategies: 1) rediscover one's hyperdifferentiated life; 2) think politically; 3) seek out interstitial spaces; 4) change one's point of entry.<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: Webb identifies hyperbole as operating within the thought of a number of philosophers and writers, including William James, Friedrich Nietzsche, Søren Kierkegaard, Georges Bataille, Flannery O'Connor, G. K. Chesterton, and Karl Barth (1993a, 1993b, 1995).
         
               As a theologian, Webb also views certain theological concepts such as charity, grace, ethics, the gift, and love as hyperbolic (1996, 2000). He suggests, and I agree with him, that religious language and the project of theology itself are hyperbolic—for example, the assertion of Christ's divinity is hyperbolic, and “the eschatological imagination is a dramatic exaggeration of the basic human desire for satisfaction and harmony” (1999, 13). Hyperbole is not simply a ridiculous utterance that is easily dismissed. What Ricoeur and Webb each confirm is that hyperbole is a mode of thought and a practice of excess that can reveal theo-philosophical insight and express what cannot be expressed in any other way. It is a play with extremity at the boundaries of reason and rationality whereby logical thought forms are opened up to radical perspectival expressions; it is a “consent to a perspective from which certain views would not otherwise exist” (Webb4
            1993a, 20). Identifying or adopting a hyperbolic perspective, however, is more than a theoretical mode of thought, just as it is more than a simple and obvious trope.<br>
