Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con<br>

Journal Title: Oxford Art Journal<br>
Article Title: Varying the Self: Bacon's Versions of van Gogh<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i282749<br>
Date: 1 1, 1947<br>
Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>

Abstract: Janicaud's most thought-provoking suggestions arise out of his attempt to challenge hermeneutic phenomenology from the outside and to show that it imposes an illegitimate narrowing of the scope of phenomenological appearing. Here, Janicaud calls on the assistance of Gilles Deleuze, who famously denounces phenomenology and hermeneutics as “the two diseases of the earth, the pair of the despot and priest.”
         
               Deleuze links phenomenology, on the one hand, to the figure of the despot, in light of its effort to establish the transcendental ego as the source and master of all meaning. Hermeneutics, on the other hand, is linked to the figure of the priest, inasmuch as its search for hidden meanings is suspected to carry the residue of its biblical lineage, with its pursuit of the divine. These two discourses, though separate, suffer in fact from the same underlying disease: the choice for meaning. This choice, for Deleuze, imposes a restriction on their scope, which implies that they are only able to address the aftereffects or residues of a pre-subjective and pre-objective life that they ignore.18<br>
