  Reflections on the Work of Paul Ricoeur from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: What do Paul Ricoeur and Amartya Sen have to do with one another? On the surface, not much. Ricoeur is a French hermeneutic philosopher and theologian; Sen is a Nobel Prize–winning Indian economist. Ricoeur researches such topics as subjectivity, imagination, and memory; Sen, poverty, development, and famine. But beneath their surface differences lies a fundamental similarity in their respective projects. Both take the notion of human capability as the central descriptive and normative feature of human existence. For Ricoeur, the capable human being (
                  l’homme capable) is the ultimate subject of philosophical analysis. For Sen, the right to capabilities forms<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutics of the symbol paves the way for hermeneutical relevance to social science and practical philosophy. According to Ricoeur, we must think not behind the symbols, but start from symbols. In short, the symbol gives rise to thought (thought in the sense of philosophical reflection).¹ In

  Abstract: As a beginning philosopher, Ricoeur found himself at the juncture of three major philosophical orientations: the French reflexive philosophy, the philosophy of existence of Gabriel Marcel and Karl Jaspers, and Husserl’s descriptive phenomenology.¹ French reflexive philosophy appears in Ricoeur’s own description as a way of thinking which can be traced back to the Cartesian
                  cogito, through Kant and the French post-Kantianism, having Jean Nabert as its most prominent figure.² If preoccupation with epistemological issues, translated in the predominance of matters of justification and certitude, has been the overriding concern of such a line of thought, what Ricoeur retains from reflexive<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

Abstract: It is at this level of “text” that we are able to speak of a unit of meaning as having a semiautonomous existence. A text is to some extent detached from the conditions of its production, but it is not completely autonomous. Rather, it is mediation in three dimensions: between man and world, between man and man, and between man and himself. According to Ricoeur, the first mediation is referentiality, the second is communicability, and the third is self‐understanding [
         31]. He shows how hermeneutics describes, as well as the interpretation of texts, the whole activity at the point of intersection of the (internal) configuration of the work and the (external) refiguration of life [18].<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Publisher: American Historical Association<br>
Issue: 587015<br>
Date: April 2003<br>
Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses the anatheist option of returning to God after the atheistic critique of the traditional God of ontotheology. It begins by reviewing the contributions that Levinas and Derrida have made toward this position and the atheistic criticisms of Freud and Nietzsche. The work of Paul Ricoeur is then discussed, showing how the atheist critique is a necessary moment in the development of genuine faith that involves a renunciation of fear and dependency as well as a reaffirmation of life and a return to existence. Kearney goes on to discuss how this return to God is possible, considering the ethical position that makes it possible, the reinterpretations of biblical traditions that it entails, the relationship between the anatheist philosopher and the theologian, and revival of God as an enabling God.<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos.

El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of the agential spiral is both derived from and builds on Paul Ricoeur's concept of “threefold mimesis.” Developed most explicitly in
      Time and Narrative, “threefold mimesis” traces how narrative represents human action by emplotting it in a framework of temporality. Ricoeur views time and narrative as integral elements of the human condition and our own understanding of it: “Time becomes human to the extent that it is articulated through a narrative mode, and narrative attains its full meaning when it becomes a condition of temporal existence” (1984, 1:52). The narrative creates an imagined world that, in turn, leads readers to act in the real world. Although Ricoeur gestures toward the public judgment and action that are the end of persuasion, he turns back to the individual experience of catharsis—the end of poetics—to explain how the reader “appropriates” the world of the read text. The concept of appropriation presented by Ricoeur primarily refers to the phenomenological experience of a change in perspective rather than a rhetorically produced orientation toward public action. I argue that Ricoeur's emphasis on appropriation through catharsis limits the usefulness of threefold mimesis as a means of understanding how texts (in our case, texts or practices of public memory) invite specificallypublicactions. Therefore, my reading of Ricoeur draws attention to two issues that Ricoeur underemphasizes. First, my reading highlights both the various agents who interpret and act on the past and their transhistorical relationships with one another. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how public memories respond to diachronic as well as synchronic collective contexts. Focusing on these performances of agency enables critical scholars to see how the representation of agency itself can link past, present, and future. Second, I use Maurice Charland's familiar concept of constitutive rhetoric to knit Ricoeur's ideas more tightly to rhetorical conce~<br>

Abstract: Yes, regrettably, the species is fallen and the will is impaired. Nevertheless, these deficiencies are remediable for Shaw and Ricoeur. The two place unwavering faith in the ineradicable goodness of creation and lodge unflagging hope in the inextirpable capacity of humans to repair the damage they have done to themselves and the planet that houses them. Things can be different. Lives need not be beggared. Tomorrow can be better than today. This is the inspiriting wager Shaw and Ricoeur make, with eyes fully open to the countless maladies that mar existence. Through the maelstroms that swirled around them, they stayed the course, undaunted: they remained faithful, hopeful, spiritual, creative, and humane; they lived long, active, and productive lives of notable achievement; they made uplifting the least advantaged the locus of their ameliorative efforts; they sought justice, equality, and reconciliation for everyone; and the world is a much better place because of them. By such benchmarks, Shaw and Ricoeur epitomize wellness. For these kindred spirits, ever the intrepid circumnavigators of the entropic regions, one touch of the divine that permeates the universe makes us all brothers and sisters under the skin. Accordingly, as harried members of a single global family under siege, it follows in their thinking that we are responsible for one another's welfare, and that we cannot save our individual selves apart from saving humankind at large. Hence, we cannot injure someone unjustly, or allow another to suffer unnecessarily, without diminishing ourselves. In the inclusive society they envision, our shared humanity elicits shared responses to life's exigencies wherever they occur.<br>
