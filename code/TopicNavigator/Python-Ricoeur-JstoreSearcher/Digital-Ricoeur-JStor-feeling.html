Journal Title: Modern Philology<br>
Article Title: Animals, Poetry, Philosophy, and Dante's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>

Abstract: As Ricoeur elaborates it, “metaphor” as a semantic process has the power to transfer sentiments, so that in its poetic function, metaphor stretches the power of the double sense (sign and signified, vehicle and tenor, subject and predicate, or principal subject and modifier) from the cognitive to the affective.
         28Melandri also associates this approach with Max Black, who himself takes inspiration from I. A. Richards, who writes, “When we use a metaphor we have two thoughts of different things active together and supported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a resultant of their interaction.”29He identifies this same conception as more brilliantly developed in Arthur Koestler'sThe Act of Creation, in which the metaphor's “bisociation” brings forth many other composite phenomena than those initially found in the analogy.30Of Dante and the Bible, Ricoeur writes, “Si la métaphore consiste à parler d'une chose dans les termes d'une autre, ne consiste-t-elle pas aussi à percevoir, penser ou sentir, a propos d'une chose, dans les termes d'une autre?” (If metaphor consists in speaking of a thing in the terms of another, does it not consist also in perceiving, thinking or feeling, about one thing in the terms of the other?)31In other words, metaphor offers us this “insight”—to perceive, think, feel, even perhaps be or become like another. It allows us to experience entrance into the other, in a sense capturing a rapturous condition of mankind beyond or before hierarchies, dichotomies, and binaries. Identifying this approach to metaphor with post-Cartesianism and Heidegger, Melandri, like Badiou, calls this the “sympathy” aspect of the hermeneutics of the analogy.32<br>

Abstract: See Ortenberg, "Drawing Practices," esp. chap. 4, for a discussion of how many working drawings of ca. 1900 were produced for purposes of aesthetics, pedagogy, and etiquette. The dissertation's theoretical framework is influenced by the notion of ideology as developed by French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, whose
               Lectures on Ideology and Utopia(New York: Columbia University Press, 1986) argues that ideology performs a number of roles, from preserving the status quo to giving the feeling of purpose in everyday life and inspiring agents to strive for excellence.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Hyperboles are a contextual response to an exigence just as much as they are a way of perceiving and approaching meaning and being in general. Often creating intense
         affectusin the audience, Johnson suggests, “the hyperbolist perceives an extraordinary, outrageous, ridiculous, or ineffableres(thing, event, feeling, idea), while his or herverba(words, speech, language) strain discursive limits, analogical frameworks, and literary and rhetorical conventions, to represent thatres” (2010, 2). Here Johnson indicates that one would not use hyperbole or adopt a hyperbolic perspective unless the magnitude of some event or experience called for and justified its use. To be sure, those such as Levinas are responding to an extraordinary, contextualized experience or event, though it may not be readily apparent that their response is a hyperbolic one, and so the next question for hyperbole thus becomes one of intent. It is often presumed that hyperbole must be intentional, but as Ricoeur and Webb indicate, that is not necessarily the case, since one may be engaging in a practice of excess in philosophical argumentation in response to some extraordinary exigence without being fully aware that one is assuming a hyperbolic mode of thought.<br>

Abstract: Fortunately, we do not have to choose between the two reigning theories in terms of validity or comprehensiveness. Nor do we have to concern ourselves with any overlap that may exist between them. Rather, we can profitably employ them jointly as backgrounded templates for exhibiting the general contours of hope as these defining characteristics reveal themselves in the lives of Shaw and Ricoeur. When we take this approach, an eerie feeling of déjà vu ensues. It is almost as if the leading theoreticians actually studied in depth the biographical details of our principals or interviewed them periodically at length in constructing their perspectives on hope. We virtually see Shaw and Ricoeur in the particulars of the theories they provide. Hence, the thorny issue of what hope actually is—a state of mind, a galvanizing affect, or some combination of the cognitive and the emotional—is essentially moot for what we are trying to accomplish. Our focus is not primarily on the psychodynamics of hope. Professionals in the relevant disciplines can debate the merits of the competing arguments under consideration. For us, it suffices to establish that Shaw and Ricoeur are instructive exemplars, archetypes, or case studies of what hopeful individuals are like in relation to wellness, regardless of the specific theoretical stance on hope behavioral specialists can bring to bear on the endeavor.<br>
