  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: In a world where justice appears to be the most one can ask for, there is no room for forgiveness and much space for the particular cruelties practiced in the name of the war against wickedness. Significantly, those who stress justice often turn it most harshly upon themselves. According to Paul Ricoeur in
                  The Symbolism of Evil,to trace the history of men’s reactions to sin helps us to distinguish the stages through which mankind has moved in its reactions to the world. In the earliest stage, the force that punished the guilty lay outside men. Once conscience became consciousness,<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: In addition to developing a theological anthropology, Regan lays the groundwork for a human rights praxis of “just memory,” drawing on the work of Paul Ricoeur. Situating human rights discourse between the memory of suffering and the hope for a better future, Regan develops an ethics toward just memory, which includes allowing individuals to face the scars and wounds of memory in order to work through the past (101), enabling the pragmatic use of memory throughout a community through construction of narrative (101–2), and articulating an ethical-political duty of remembrance for purposes of preventing destructive tendencies, allowing the possibility of forgiveness, and retaining a heritage of victimization to counter the historical tendency to celebrate victors (102). Regan discusses the report of human rights violations and their individual and societal impacts, produced by the Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, as an example of how such an ethic can be put into practice.<br>

Article Title: EMPLOTTING FORGIVENESS: NARRATIVE, FORGETTING AND MEMORY<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922201<br>
Date: 6 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Tran Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Miroslav Volf has provocatively argued that redemption necessitates forgetting (1996, 2006). Yet, Volf's claims insufficiently consider the narratival configuration of memory. This essay utilises Paul Ricoeur's work on mimesis in order to challenge Volf's case for forgetting. The author advances Ricoeur's philosophical description of forgiveness toward a theological account of divine forgiveness as re-narration, gift-giving funded by trinitarian abundance.<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Finally, Ricoeur's formulation of threefold mimesis in
      Time and Narrativefocuses on agency but does not specifically consider its function in the production and consumption of public memory. Ricoeur's most substantive, explicit discussion of the relationship between public remembering and public acting appears in the epilogue ofMemory, History, Forgetting, where he uses Arendt's work to address the problem of forgiveness (2004, 457–506). Although incredibly illuminating, this philosophical investigation does not aim to provide a strategy for reading examples of memory—or, more specifically, thepublicmemory that interests rhetorical critics.
               Yet Ricoeur's earlier works link agency to temporality and the world in ways that can be productively adapted as a hermeneutic tool for reading practices of public memory. Ricoeur approaches agency as a time-bound, text-mediated capacity to affect the self and envision a new world. My conception of the agential spiral takes Ricoeur's threefold mimesis a step further by considering how a specific set of texts figures agency in ways that are inspired by past actions, shaped by contemporary public cultures, and potentially productive of future agency.7<br>
