Abstract: But even if Faustus performs the affects of repentance, he cannot repent and be saved in the strict theological sense because until the very end he exhibits the inward disposition of the faithless magician who must choose to be duped by Satan. But why does he have such an inward disposition in the first place? Is it indeed that God has predestined Faustus to hell, subjected him to the most miserable necessity? For Paul Ricoeur, the question of “the scandalous theology of predestination to evil” is the tragic question par excellence, which is why the tragic is always, in Ricoeur's formulation, “a temptation to despair” in its display of the “hostile transcendence to which the hero is prey.”
      36But Marlowe's play, as much as it also invites the audience to despair, stages something more subtle and finally more wrenching than blank divine vengeance, for in fact it employs the more charitable theology represented by Holland rather than that of Perkins: Faustus may indeed repent, and God may indeed change his mind. The possibility of repentance provides the suspense that makes the play dramatic rather than merely iconographical, and that gives force and fear to those apparently trivial spectacles that repeatedly persuade Faustus not to perform his inward penance. Yet at the same time, there does seem to be something fated in the way that Faustus is introduced to the audience with a habit of mind that makes it impossible for him to take his given opportunities to repent.Doctor Faustusthus brings the audience right up against the nondialectical, and therefore tragic, contradiction of the theology of grace: the fact an omnipotent and supposedly loving God permits creaturely suffering, or, in terms more specific to the play, that God rejects a man who cries out to him simply because that man thinks like a dramatist rather than an allegorist.37Milton, on his part, tries to solve this problem at the heart of Christianity with a theodicy of human insufficiency—the archange<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>

Abstract: This example, albeit brief, already provides an important clue about the locus of the connection between Deleuze and phenomenology. For the above contrast could equally be characterized in terms of the difference between a static and a genetic phenomenology. Deleuze's transcendental empiricism, in other words, bears some resemblance to Husserl's description of the passive syntheses (temporality, habit, etc.) that precede and condition the active syntheses performed by intentional acts of consciousness. From this perspective, we can see both thinkers as inquiring into what precedes and gives rise to the meaning-formations established within a static analysis of intentional consciousness. By all accounts, Deleuze was unaware of Husserl's genetic phenomenology. But if he were, one could easily imagine that he would have been more receptive to phenomenology. And likewise, when Husserlians become aware of the new directions developed in Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, my sense is that they too will come to embrace Deleuzian insights as possible extensions of genetic phenomenology.<br>
