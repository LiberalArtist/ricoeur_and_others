Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>
