  Abstract: In his book,
                  Oneself as Another,Paul Ricoeur explains that identity is partly bound up in identification with significant others, which is the reason why, especially in autobiographies, writing the self implies writing the other. This idea resounds with one of the key insights in autobiography theory in the 1990s, namely that identity—for both men and women—is essentially relational, formed and defined in relation to others. As Laura Marcus points out, “Recounting one’s own life almost inevitably entails writing the life of an other or others; writing the life of another must surely entail the biographer’s identifications with<br>

  Abstract: For Paul Ricoeur, as for Sartre, Levinas, Patočka, and Derrida, sections 46 through 53 of 
                  Being and Time, on the existential analytic of Being-toward-death, constitute one of the most acutely confrontational passages of Heidegger’s formidable book. Bearing spirited witness to this is a long passage in part 3 of Memory, History, Forgetting, devoted to “the historical condition,” in which the philosopher of memory and history considers in his turn the identification of death with “the intimate possibility of one’s ownmost potentiality of being,” and opposes to it “an alternative reading of the potentiality of dying.”¹ However, as Ricœur was writing<br>

Abstract: The epistemological function of analogy has also been a subject of vigorous debate among philosophers and rhetoricians. Ever since Roman Jakobson’s famous (
         1973) postulation of the fundamental polarity between metaphor and metonymy at the very heart of language, the two poles have marked differences between relationships of resemblance and contiguity, Freudian identification and symbolism as opposed to displacement and condensation, or poetry and prose (Jakobson1973, 126). For Jakobson, the two modes represent not only verbal differences but cultural patterns (1973, 123). Understandably, analogy and resemblance, as constituent elements of metaphor, have not fared well with poststructuralism’s emphasis on heterogeneity. Although Paul Ricoeur ([1975] 1977) attempts to resuscitate metaphor from its disrepute by emphasizing the play of similarity and difference in metaphor and by associating resemblance “as the site of clash between sameness and difference” ([1975] 1977, 196), he does not bridge the divide between relations of likeness and unlikeness and those of contiguity. While I do not wish to claim any utopian possibilities for metonymy or posit a neat structuralist break between metonymy and metaphor, I find that the reliance on a dominant mode of analogy and metaphor amid postmodern gender/sexuality theorizing reveals the epistemological fracture caused by racial difference. Therefore, I argue that the role of racial analogy, resemblance, and metaphor within feminist/gender theory needs to be thoroughly investigated. Postcolonial theory has already revealed how analogy and metaphor have been fundamental in constituting colonial discourse. As Edward Said so powerfully demonstrated, Orientalism as colonial discourse operated in part by making woman a metaphor for the Orient (1978, 6, 187–88). And the disciplining of the colonies only involved the flip side of analogy—the postulation of absolute difference between colonizer and colonized, civilized and pri~<br>

Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur drives his investigation with his characteristic hermeneutical analysis of both canonical and unanticipated authors. The first chapter covers the field of “Recognition as Identification” with texts of Descartes, Kant, and Marcel Proust. Knowledge theories have indeed treated “recognition as identification” under the heading of judgment: that of judging an object as “the same” through an identification process. Ricoeur traces in the
      Meditationsof Descartes the occurrences of the verb “to recognize” at moments following expression of doubts and hesitations. As is the case in the subsequent discussion of Kant, Ricoeur does not directly engage the issues here. His goal is instead to show that these canonical theories of knowledge miss an important lesson of recognition.<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: La psychanalyse freudienne est de bout en bout interprétation ; Freud établit des règles pour l'interprétation, il donne une clé herméneutique, et ébranle et met en mouvement les interprétations existantes que l'homme donne de soi-même et du monde. D'autre part il est remarquable que l'oeuvre de Freud est inconnue et méconnue dans la littérature herméneutique. P. Ricoeur est le premier qui ait compris qu'on ne peut pas se passer de Freud comme interlocuteur lors de la discussion sur l'herméneutique. Freud fonctionne, selon Ricoeur, comme démystificateur. Il démasque les illusions. Une seconde lecture de Freud est la remise en question des intentions réductrices. Dans son essai sur Freud la réflexion, l'interprétation comprise comme réduction de l'illusion, et l'interprétation entendue comme restauration du sens constituent une unité dialectique. Mais schatten. Of hij echter van de echte wijsgerige intentie veel begrepen heeft kan men betwijfelen. Ricoeur ne parle jamais de l'acte psychanalytique ou du dialogue psychanalytique en tant que tel. C'est pour cette raison que la vraie portée de la découverte freudienne se perd probablement. Dans l'acte psychanalytique il se révèle que l'homme est situé dans un langage et dans un discours transindividuel. Un discours qui est en même temps présentation, objectivation, identification, apologie, provocation, frustration et aliénation. Le langage, selon Lacan, a une primauté sur le sujet parlant et le discours transindividuel est irréductible. La primauté du langage et du discours, considérée comme irréductible peut changer et éclairer d'une façon toute nouvelle les questions fondamentales de l'herméneutique actuelle.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>
