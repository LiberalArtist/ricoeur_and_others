  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Religion<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509553<br>
Date: 04 2007<br>
Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Article Title: Remembering the Future; or, Whatever Happened to Re‐Vision?<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 518276<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Article Title: Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History<br>
Publisher: American Historical Association<br>
Issue: 587009<br>
Date: February 2002<br>
Author(s): Bender Thomas<br>
Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Article Title: Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff<br>
Publisher: American Historical Association<br>
Issue: 587015<br>
Date: April 2003<br>
Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Author(s): Griffioen Sander<br>
Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: For example, Ricoeur says he aims to formulate a position that 'without really
contradicting Gadamer's hermeneutics, will rectify it in a manner décisive for the debate
with the critique of ideology' (in 'Hermeneutics and the Critique of ideology', in Herme-

Abstract: Insufficiently radical environmentalism is inadequate to the problems that confront us; but overly radical environmentalism risks alienating people with whom, in a democracy, we must find common cause. Building on Paul Ricoeur's work, which shows how group identity is constituted by the tension between ideology and utopia, this essay asks just how radical effective environmentalism should be. Two "case studies" of environmental agenda—that of Michael Schellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, and that of David Brower—serve to frame the important issues of cooperation and confrontation. The essay concludes that environmentalism must lead with its utopian aspirations rather than its willingness to compromise.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Abstract: To sum up, hope and faith are crucial to human wellness, singly and in the aggregate; they are, in this respect, salutary virtues. Both are indispensable to the species' prospects for flourishing, but in the ordinary course of events, neither is indestructible. Each can wane, to one degree or another; and, in extremis, each may succumb to the experientially insurmountable. And when one expires, the other loses its efficaciousness in the process. In theory, faith is simultaneously source, foundation, and trigger whereas hope is at once derivative, dependent, and active. Without faith, hope fades to nothingness, and so too does living, leaving the race impoverished at every level. The hopeless, if they survive at all, live grim, stunted, and joyless lives. Without a therapeutic intervention, the prognosis for the hopelessly morose is bleak: unrelenting gloom, or worse. Hope—be it cognitively or emotionally based, or mixed—is the anticipation of future goods, and faith is the conviction that future goods can be realized. Faith has multiple sources, among them religion, science, esteemed others, or the self, no one of which is necessarily infallible or unconditionally trustworthy. Hence, the faith-hope nexus may exist in a healthy or a pathological state, depending on whether the forward-looking gaze is tied to objective actuality, escapist idealism, or distortive ideology. If eyes are irrevocably fixed in the wrong direction, wishes are bound to be disappointed and harm, on a grand scale, may be the result. Yet even if faith, as well as any correlative hope it generates, is firmly grounded in reality, there is no guarantee of success. Things go awry, for a variety of reasons, some predictable, some not. Faith, then, is always a wager, and a risky, sometimes perilous, one at that. Faith can stumble, fail, or disintegrate, extinguishing in its demise any lingering vestiges of hope.<br>
