  Abstract: A través de este texto hemos intentado poner en conversación a Paul Ricoeur y otros personajes que irán apareciendo a lo largo de la exposición, quizás algunos vinculados a mundos del arte o del escenario, pero que sin ninguna duda son orfebres de la palabra, cantautores del alma o filósofos de la vida. Al fin y al cabo, fue labor de aedos y rapsodas el que parte de la Historia trascendiera y no cayera en el olvido.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Abstract: However, as Shaw and Ricoeur well understood, the precariousness of hope and faith does not imply that we should resign ourselves to inertia. Inaction in the face of a looming challenge or an impending calamity is not a productive strategy; it just makes it that much easier for our most dreaded fears to come to pass. Evil is liable to prevail if people of good will do nothing, says the venerable aphorism. We may not know everything, but some things we do know—and those bits of knowledge might ultimately prove decisive in tipping the scales in favor of a faltering species were they to be acted on judiciously. Besides, can anyone live, in any meaningful sense of the term, without trusting in something? Not likely; and as we will soon see, faith is an all-in bet Shaw and Ricoeur courageously make, in full awareness of the way of the world. Despite the potential for disappointment, heartbreak, or crushing defeat, they embrace faith and they embody hope, not just intermittently but persistently. Although buffeted roughly by life's inescapable headwinds, neither acquiesces to dejection; neither renounces humankind; and, to the very end, both labor to ease the lot of those society has unwisely left behind. In addition, the two view the world principally through the lens of the sacred. For them, faith and hope in tandem supply a spiritual dimension to an existence that otherwise might lack an element of awe-inspiring transcendence. For the faithful and hopeful who incline toward religion, as do Shaw and Ricoeur, the numinous persists in our midst and not only nourishes the soul but also elicits a reverence for creation's grandeur that carries with it the certitude that we live best when we serve a purpose beyond shallow self-aggrandizement. That purpose, according to Shaw and Ricoeur, is helping to bring about ever more bountiful life on an equitable, peaceful, and flourishing planet. The paradigm they choose to emulate here is the catholic Jesus—not Jesus the sacrificial s<br>
