Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Article Title: Book Reviews<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522257<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: There is a good body of work in recent French philosophy on the issue of recognition. Emmanuel Renault, Christian Lazerri, and the antiutilitarian MAUSS (Mouvement anti‐utilitariste en sciences sociales) come readily to mind. Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor are influential, but so, too, are Bourdieu and other French sociologists. In spite of the original contributions of these French authors, none of their work has been made available to English readers to date. A first step toward filling this lack has been made with this translation of the final opus of the recently deceased Paul Ricoeur on the theme of recognition.<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Modern History<br>
Publisher: Éditions du Cerf<br>
Issue: 598752<br>
Date: 3 2006<br>
Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Religion<br>
Article Title: Paul Ricoeur's Notion of "Diagnostics": Its Function in Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i251516<br>
Date: 4 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Gerhart Mary<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur, "Metaphor and the Main Problem of Hermeneutics": The understanding of
interpretation as a reciprocity between text interpretation and self-interpretation "has been
opposed mainly by logical positivists, but also for opposite reasons by Romantic thinkers,
who oppose the kind of objectivity and the lack of self-involvement which is supposed to
characterize a scientific explanation of things" (p. 1).<br>

Journal Title: Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory: J-PART<br>
Article Title: A Hermeneutic Approach to Explaining and Understanding Public Controversies<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23319479<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Leong Ching<br>
Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Journal Title: Neotestamentica<br>
Article Title: THE EXTERIORITY OF BIBLICAL MEANING AND THE PLENTITUDE OF DESIRE: AN EXPLORATION OF DELEUZE'S NON-METAPHYSICAL HERMENEUTICS OF KAFKA<br>
Publisher: The New Testament Society of South Africa / Die Nuwe-Testamentiese Werkgemeenskap van Suid-Afrika<br>
Issue: i40118237<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical theory remains rooted in a metaphysics of the "interiority of meaning". For example, Ricoeur transposed Freud's metaphysics of interior libidinal meaning into a literary theory of interpretation. The corollary to Freud's metaphysics of interiorized meaning is "desire as lack". Deleuze and Guattari's attack on Freud's theory of historical-libidinal drives formed the basis of their explication of the "rhizomatic" exteriority of meaning, which they develop, in literary terms, in their book, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In their view, Kafka's novels model a style of writing that disavows interior meaning. They also oppose the primacy of Freud's concept of desire-as-lack with that of desire-as-plenitude. This paper will discuss a mode of biblical interpretation based on the twin concepts of exteriority of meaning and desire-as-plentitude, according to four interpretive stategies: 1) rediscover one's hyperdifferentiated life; 2) think politically; 3) seek out interstitial spaces; 4) change one's point of entry.<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: I turn to Ricoeur's work first because of its resonances with rhetorical studies. Scholars such as Michael Leff, Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, and Barbara Warnick have productively engaged some of these common themes, but there has not been a sustained effort to use his insights in rhetorical analysis generally, let alone in the rhetorical analysis of memory (Hauser
         1999; Leff1987and2003; Ritivoi2006; Warnick1987).
               This lack of attention may result in part from Ricoeur's own ambivalence toward rhetoric, which he once described as “philosophy's oldest enemy and its oldest ally” (1977, 10). Although Ricoeur maintained a rather narrow view of rhetoric, his preoccupation with its themes suggests that scholars of rhetoric can discover ideas in his work that can be developed into tools for critical analysis. Therefore, this article intends to contribute to a broader—albeit currently only intermittent—effort to assess the resonances between Ricoeur's work and the rhetorical tradition and to fashion useful tools from those mutual concerns.1<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: In addition, Ricoeur believes that a purely deontological framework like Kant's is insufficiently sensitive to the asymmetry inherent in human action. Humans not only do evil, they also suffer evil at the hands of others, and disproportionately so when they are the innocent victims of ignominious power. Much to our regret, the powerful few can bring whole peoples and nations to their knees, or very nearly annihilate them altogether, if they are fanatics and lack restraint. Precisely because others may be the non-consenting recipients of our actions, Ricoeur argues, we ought to treat them with the same solicitude we treat ourselves. And we should do so graciously, he adds, not with the expectation of receiving something of equal or greater value in return, but out of a sense of gratitude for the plenitude that has been given us. Hence, for Ricoeur, the primary concern of ethics is less about honoring rigid rules and more about taking responsibility for the welfare of others. Under the aegis of the good, decency obliges us first and foremost to minimize violence against the person, in all it nefarious forms, so that we can then maximize human flourishing across the globe—all of which brings Ricoeur well within the orbit of Shaw, who shares the same priorities and whose ethics is similarly teleological.<br>
