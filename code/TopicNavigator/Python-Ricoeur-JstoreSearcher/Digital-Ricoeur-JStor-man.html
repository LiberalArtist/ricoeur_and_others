  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine how Richard Wright, in
                  The Man Who Lived Underground(1944), puts into practice what Paul Ricoeur describes as metaphor’s knowledge of its relation to being.¹ The poetics I describe are evident not in this novella alone; they appear in many familiar works of African American literature throughout the modern period.² While this chapter cannot, of course, lay claim to a comprehensive study that presents an exhaustive overview of all the texts that constitute this literary tradition; my hope is that my analysis will suggest a theory of metaphor alive in Wright’s work, a theory that<br>

Abstract: It is at this level of “text” that we are able to speak of a unit of meaning as having a semiautonomous existence. A text is to some extent detached from the conditions of its production, but it is not completely autonomous. Rather, it is mediation in three dimensions: between man and world, between man and man, and between man and himself. According to Ricoeur, the first mediation is referentiality, the second is communicability, and the third is self‐understanding [
         31]. He shows how hermeneutics describes, as well as the interpretation of texts, the whole activity at the point of intersection of the (internal) configuration of the work and the (external) refiguration of life [18].<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: If anything characterizes our age it is the many endangerments to and alterations of life ranging from the genetic to the planetary. In this situation, some thinkers insist that we need a heuristics of fear about the possible end of nature and also to focus on human mortality in order to evoke a sense of responsibility.
         35Jacques Derrida puts this forcefully inThe Gift of Death. “My irreplaceability is therefore conferred, delivered, ‘given,' one can say, by death. It is the same gift, the same source, one could say the same goodness and the same law. It is from the site of death as the place of my irreplaceability, that is, of my singularity, that I feel called to responsibility. In this sense only a mortal can be responsible.”36As Socrates is reported to have claimed, philosophy is about learning to die. Yet that is not quite right, I submit. While showing wherein the consciousness of responsibility might arise—that is, in the singularity of being toward death, my own or that of the other—the focus on mortality by Socrates, Derrida, Ricoeur, and others cannot clarify the purpose of responsibility, that is, the good human power is to serve. At best, it discloses that we ought not to do harm, a demand of nonmaleficence. Ethical reflection on how we ought to live too often dodges the question of why we ought to affirm life, our own, that of others, and also the wider compass of life on this planet. Here religious resources can and must be explored. That is, too often a theological or philosophical ethicist fails to grasp what Augustine profoundly understood, namely, that the remembrance of death is itself inscribed within life, and, therefore, one can bring this vitality to articulation in terms of the good that moral responsibility can and ought to respect and enhance.37This opens and requires theological reflection into responsibility itself. How then are we to articulate the purpose of responsibility beyond the claims of a modern, humanistic orientation, ~<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],
p. 344).

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the
Problem of Evil: An Interpretative Analysis of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophy of Will (Toronto: Institute
for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft wird aus einem philosophischen Gesichtspunkt her betrachtet. Wir versuchen die Grundeinsichte dieser Sprachwissenschaft herauszuarbeiten : Sprache als autonome Entität innerlicher Differenzen und Dependenzen, Sprache als Form und nicht als Substanz. Längere Zeit ist die strukturelle Semantik vernachlässigt worden. Im Buche A. J. Greimas' : Sémantique structurale finden wir eine eindringliche Beschreibung des Aufbaues und der Strukturen der Bedeutungswelt. Mit Paul Ricoeur holen wir die philosophisch relevante Voraussetzungen des Sprachbegriffes der strukturellen Sprachwissenschaft hervor : die Sprache ist das Objekt einer empirischen Wissenschaft ; die Veränderung in der Sprache ist nur eine Bedrohung für das System der Sprache ; die Sprache ist Form, nicht Substanz ; die Sprache als strukturelles System - auch im Bereiche der Semantik - ist an der konkreten, extra-linguistischen Realität abwesend ; das Sprachzeichen soll nicht definiert werden als eine Referenz zum Ding, sondern als eine Opposition mit allen anderen Sprachzeichen und als eine innerliche Differenz zwischen dem akustischen Bilde und der Wortbedeutung. Welche Mangel hat dieser Sprachbegriff nun ? Die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft betrachtet allzu wenig die Sprache als freien Akt des Gesprächs. Nur im Gespräch leuchtet die Notwendigkeit auf, die Worte für die konkrete Realität zu öffnen. Nur im Gespräch erfährt man den Zugriff der Wirklichkeit auf die Worte. Auch orientiert sich die strukturelle Sprachwissenschaft allzu einseitig an Bedeutungswelten, in denen die Inhalte nicht die Kraft besitzen, sich eine Interpretationsgeschichte zu erringen. In letzter Zeit gibt es aber einige neuen Wege in der Sprachwissenschaft (die französische und amerikanische sind nur betrachtet worden), die vielleicht eine grössere Chance versprechen für die Möglichkeit der Öffnung der Sprache für die konkrete Realität, die das Gespräch der Menschen winkt.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: Until about 2005, it was hard to find any publication about literature during the communist era or any important work concerning this period. Since then, this astonishing silence has given way to the publication in Bulgaria of several novels and hybrid writings. In the meantime occured not only literary, but also political and social events which changed the issue: isn't the real problem in Bulgaria today no longer the institutional, generational, historiographical or literary silence, but the dilemna between the collective or individual responsability? To cope with these problems, the author takes into account both the works of Paul Ricoeur concerning the excess of memory and the excess of oblivion, the blocked memory, manipulated memory, abusively controlled or obligated memory, and two emblematic books concerning the communist past as seen in the State Security files: The Watched Man by Vesko Branev, and Surveillance and Conditioning: the literary prose of the State security by Žerminal Čivikov.

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur identifies three ways in which the mediating function of mimesis
      2operates in the configuration of narratives. First, configuration mediates between the individual event and the story as a whole by assigning an event a place of significance in the unfolding of a plot. Let us take, for instance, a book from the aforementioned Americans All series. Lillie Patterson's 1970Martin Luther King, Jr.: Man of Peace, which was awarded the first Coretta Scott King Book Award for African American children's literature, begins with an anecdote from King's childhood. This story narrates King's supposed first encounter with the “wall” of racism. When he enters school, his white friends are no longer allowed to play with him. He persists in seeking their company but is rebuffed: “Finally, their mother tried to tell Martin why. ‘You see, you are colored and they are white’” (Patterson 1970, 10). Unsatisfied, Martin goes to his own mother, who explains the history of slavery and its effects on their lives. She concludes by reminding her son that despite this past, “You are as good as anyone” (Patterson 1970, 10–12). As the opening scene, this vignette both introduces King as a child (creating an identificatory link with readers) and frames the remaining story about a confident man who worked to break down that “wall” of racism. Second, configuration joins and relates disparate aspects of the story, including various agents, actions, motivations, and outcomes. Patterson's text, for example, emphasizes both King's personal ambition and his cooperation with others. Members of his family play a key role, and the appearance of his wife, Coretta Scott, warrants an entire chapter (Patterson 1970, 33–38). Their marriage is represented not as mere love story but as the collaboration between two powerful social agents. The narrator explains that in accepting marriage to King, “Coretta decided to join the young minister and share his dream” (Patterson 1970, 37). Finally, configura~<br>

Abstract: Moreover, the astute logician in Shaw sees the newborn child as a commissioned envoy of divinity, whether that divinity is understood as the Judeo-Christian God, the Shavian Life Force, or the equivalent in some other belief system. Using the Christian sacrament of Baptism as a dispositive case in point, Shaw, always the cogent syllogist, argues that “if God is the Father of all men, and if the child is the father to man, it follows then that the true representative of God at the christening is the child itself.”
         
               Hence, from Shaw's considered viewpoint, if we seek the Kingdom of Heaven, we need not scour the galaxy frenetically. Instead, we should look no further than ourselves, for in each of us dwell effervescent particles of the same numen that breathes life into inert matter. In sum, for Shaw, every conception is immaculate,42
            
               and every child is a living incarnation of the primeval goodness that bathes the universe.43<br>
