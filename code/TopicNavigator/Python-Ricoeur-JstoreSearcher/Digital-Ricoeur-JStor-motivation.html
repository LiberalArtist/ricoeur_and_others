Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: Reprenant la célèbre distinction de Max Weber entre éthique de conviction (Gesinnnungsethik, littéralement éthique de l'intention ou de la motivation) et éthique de responsabilité (Verantwortungsethik), l'auteur, qui a exercé la charge de Conseiller fédéral à Berne, s'interroge sur ce qui pourrait différencier l'éthique du politicien de l'éthique du citoyen. Après avoir montré, à la suite de Paul Ricoeur, que l'une et l'autre sont confrontées à des questions semblables, même si elles se situent à des niveaux différents, l'article développe le sens large de la responsabilité comme parole, réponse et engagement responsable. Using Max Weber's famous distinction between an ethics of conviction (Gesinnungsethik, literally an ethics of intention or motivation) and an ethics of responsibility (Verantwortungsethik), the author, ex-Federal Councillor in Bern, reflects upon the possible differences between the ethics of the politician and that of the citizen. After showing that, following Paul Ricoeur, both are confronted with similar questions, though situated at different levels, this article develops the larger idea of responsibility as one's word, response and responsible commitment.<br>

Abstract: However, this does not mean that in attempting to fill the philosophical gap Kant bequeaths his interlocutors, Ricoeur accepts Kantian thought wholesale. He does not. While he endorses the notion of limits, Ricoeur rejects an ethics built exclusively on the idea of duty.
         
               Ricoeur does so largely because he thinks Kant mistakes the second phase of ethical theory for the first. For Ricoeur, the foundation or first phase of ethics is the teleological tilt toward ends, purposes, and the good. It is not the Kantian deontological tilt toward rules, obligations, and the right, which is derivative and comes second. A third and pivotal evaluative phase completes the ethical arc for Ricoeur: the dialectical tilt toward practical judgment in context (what Aristotle called31
            phronesis), which requires that deontological norms be measured for degrees of compliance against the supreme (first-phase) teleological standard of meritorious living before they are implemented in concrete situations.
               On Ricoeur's view, Kant's ethics of duty does not encompass the full spectrum of moral relations. It is too narrow. Beyond the difficulties associated with its formalism and ironclad maxims, Kantian ethics acknowledges only one legitimate source of moral motivation (acting out of respect for the law), whereas Ricoeur believes there are valid springs of ethical behavior beyond unadulterated practical reason. Desires, interests, fears, and aspirations to attain basic human goods and happiness are all licit motivational factors in the ethics Ricoeur valorizes.32<br>
