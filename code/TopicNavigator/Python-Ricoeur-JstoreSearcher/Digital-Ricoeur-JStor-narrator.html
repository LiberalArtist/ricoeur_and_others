Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Article Title: The Story of Abraham and Models of Human Identity<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Article Title: "Recognition Is a Form of Agreement": The Workings of Self-Narration in "The Catcher in the Rye" and "Invisible Man"<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Speculative Philosophy<br>
Article Title: Philosophy of Technology<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Beginnings: My first experience of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP) was at Northwestern University; the business meeting was trying to decide whether its name should be “the Society for Existential Philosophy and Phenomenology” or “the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy”—it spent nearly three hours with impassioned speeches made by many now departed mighty dead and others still here. I was a graduate student, just starting a dissertation on Paul Ricoeur, and I sat wondering where all this would lead. And we are now half a century later, with SPEP the second-largest philosophy group in America. The task for me is somehow to condense fifty years around a specific theme entailing technologies and their treatment by “Continental” philosophies. I will do this by doing time slices as related to a cast of characters, both individual and social. “SPEP” will be my corporate character for Continental philosophy; it is where its interests are expressed and indicated. Then as a primary individual character, I will refer to “Heidegger's ghost,” always and still a prominent figure and interpreter of Technology; here his death date, 1976, will stand for a watershed between what I will caricature as the Old Technologies and the New Technologies. I, myself, will be the narrator but also an actor, with my own three-decades-plus history in the philosophy of technology.<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>
