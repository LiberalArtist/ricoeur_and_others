Abstract: Perhaps the concept of intratextuality provides the key to solving this problem. The hermeneutical model presupposed in this concept emphasizes the receptivity of the interpreter and, in doing so, draws attention to precisely that feature of hermeneutically productive prejudices that distinguishes them from a priori judgments, namely, their capacity for change. Paul Ricoeur captures the essence of this hermeneutical model when he writes that “to understand is not to project oneself into the text but to expose oneself to it.”
         27In the context of theepocheprinciple, understanding is perhaps understood less as an act of empathy, suggesting the active participation of the interpreter in the subjective state of the author, than as an act of sympathy, whereby one renders oneself receptive to the particular experiential resonances set up by the text, resonances homologous to, but not identical with, those experienced by the original addressees. In other words, understanding presupposes a willingness to have one’s attitudes and outlook shaped by the mode of being‐in‐the‐world projected by the text.28What enables presuppositions to be productive of understanding, then, is their plasticity, their capacity for transformation, and it is this capacity that distinguishes them from the a priori attitudes that are willfully maintained in the midst of interreligious encounter.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur [
            17] begins with symbolism, having already shown that symbolisms find their expression within language. He defines a symbol as “any structure of significance in which a direct, primary, literal meaning designates, in addition, another meaning which is indirect, secondary, and figurative and which can be apprehended only through the first” [18, p. 98], and he defines interpretation as “the work of thought which consists in deciphering the hidden meaning in the apparent meaning, in unfolding the levels of meaning implied in the literal meaning” [18, p. 98]. The symbol, therefore, invites our participation because it “calls for an interpretation, precisely because it says more than it says and because it never ceases to speak to us” [19, p. 27]. At this level of a hermeneutics of interpretation, Ricoeur argues that symbol and interpretation become correlative concepts; there is interpretation wherever there is multiple meaning, and it is in interpretation that the plurality of meanings is manifested [18]. In other words, at the level of symbol there is a gap, a distance between the symbol itself and what the symbol stands for. It is at this level that interpretation is the movement between them; we can say that as soon as there is distance, there is relationship and the possibility for this relationship to be productive.<br>

Article Title: Translating Time: The Nature and Function of Joseph Smith’s Narrative Canon<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Abstract: As conveniently categorized by Ricoeur in his comparisons of pagan and Jewish creation myths, three aspects of Genesis are central to P’s monotheistic challenge to his pagan neighbors: Adam’s ancestral role as the first human, his defection from God by eating the forbidden fruit, and the subordination of Eve and the serpent to Adam’s story.
         45Together these elements of the Genesis story distinguish it as an anthropomorphic myth that is motivated, Ricoeur argues, by the need to give meaning to the universal human experience of evil while simultaneously upholding Israel’s faith in an ethical or good God whose creation is good (not tragic, like that of the Greeks) and good ipso facto (not ordered from chaos, like that of the Babylonians).46The narrative does not fully cooperate with P’s argument for the absolute priority of good over evil, however. Both the snake, who appears with the offer of evil, and Eve, who responds to it, imply the existence of evil in creation and prior to human act. Thus, biblical scholarship has postulated that Eve and the snake are marginal figures in Adam’s story, even residuals of pagan mythology. While the snake as a demon and Eve, its instrument, express the possibility of evil, they are not necessary to the story, merely adding “enigmatic depth” to the Israelite narrative of Adam’s transgression.47Thus interpreted, these same three features of the Genesis account frame the traditional Christian doctrines of creation ex nihilo and original sin. Smith’s narrative begins by enlarging the frame and, in doing so, makes ideological space for human participation in the divine nature.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Dès l'immédiat après-guerre des relations se sont nouées entre Paul Ricœur et la Suisse romande; elles seront durables, attestées par le double mouvement de ses fréquentes interventions ici et des nombreux passages d'étudiants romands dans ses cours, tant à Strasbourg qu'à Paris. Cet article repère quelques moments significatifs de ces échanges, dans leur diversité. In the immediate post-war years, lasting relationships grew between Paul Ricoeur and French-speaking Switzerland, as seen in his frequent participation in events here and by the numerous French-speaking Swiss students who attended his courses both in Strasbourg and Paris. This article recalls various significant moments in these diverse exchanges.<br>
