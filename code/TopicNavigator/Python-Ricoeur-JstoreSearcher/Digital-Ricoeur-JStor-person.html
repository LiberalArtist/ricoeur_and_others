  Abstract: In mainstream theories of world politics, the workings of political power are usually seen as a historical constant. They share the view expressed so clearly by Paul Ricoeur that “power does not have much of a history.”¹ At the same time, political power is overwhelmingly associated with “the modern state,” to which all states are supposed to correspond, but which is usually a version of France, England, or the United States regarded as a unitary actor equivalent to an individual person. Political power is envisioned in terms of units of territorial sovereignty (at least for the so-called Great Powers) that<br>

  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: My original encounter with the person and the work of Paul Ricoeur began with an attempt to appropriate his thought for the retrieval of the symbolic. This led to a concern with what I called
                  mythic-symboliclanguage correlated with anthropological considerations about the nature of the human, subjectivity, the self—stemming from hisPhilosophy of the Will. At that time I had been meeting once a week with the Romanian phenomenologist of religion Mircea Eliade to discuss his work in general, which I wanted to write about. I had told Eliade that I was not particularly interested in his classes;<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: By contrast with both Ricoeur and Kermode, Frei emphasizes narrative in order to foreground a way of reading that centers on the person of Jesus as the one who unifies the disparate genres and texts of scripture. This involves shifting the focus from the
         whatof Jesus’s life to thewho—or better, only understanding what Jesus does in light of who he is. As is clear in many of Frei’s writings, but particularly inThe Identity of Jesus Christ, the danger in focusing on the “what”—the meaning of the text, or the quality that we attribute to Jesus’s presence—is that our appropriation of this quality (e.g., the wandering stranger, or the human being fully open to God‐consciousness) effaces the textual ascription of this quality to Jesus himself. It is by ascribing the qualities to Jesus, in the act of figural reading, that one turns away from the interpreting subject. As the qualities become markers of Christ’s identity, they no longer serve as general concepts representative of human nature. It is less, I think, that the subject is dispossessed (though this may happen), than that the subject becomes possessed by Jesus.<br>

Abstract: The Ricoeurian hermeneutical circle requires further modification, however, if it is to answer to the full challenge of childism. This modification reflects my own and others’ sympathetic revisions of Ricoeurian hermeneutics in a more postmodern direction. Childhood raises to an especially sharp degree the problem of what Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Sallie McFague, and Richard Kearney have called the interpretation of “otherness” or “difference.” In my view it is possible, indeed necessary, to recognize otherness without (as some have claimed) abandoning the notion of a hermeneutical circle. “Otherness” does not mean “othering”: the marginalization of those who are different. Rather, it refers to the sense in which each singular human being is ultimately irreducible to any understanding, narration, or construction of them whatsoever. Levinas claims that no other is fully reducible to anything “said” about them but is always also its own transcending or infinite “saying” beyond language and meaning (indeed, as a “face” of the Wholly Other).
         34Or as others have argued, a little differently, each “other” person continually escapes interpretation as a linguistic object by virtue of their utter and mysteriousdifférance(their difference as endlessly deferred).<br>

Abstract: We can find some initial resources from phenomenological hermeneutics in the work of Paul Ricoeur, one of the leading hermeneutical ethicists of the twentieth century, and in particular in his “poetics of the will.” Adapting the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, Ricoeur argues that ethical willing and action rest ultimately upon a human capability for “ethical intentionality.” Moral practice first springs from neither subjective feelings nor objective laws or values but from humanity’s dynamic and innovative “desire to be” as an active participant in and shaper of its world. This ethical intentionality or being‐in‐the‐world has religious dimensions in that it may be affirmed, more primordially than historical corruption, as humanity’s “absolutely primitive … joyous affirmation of being‐able‐to‐be [
         pouvoir‐être].”25Ethical intentionality is a human capability that is never completed in this world itself. It consists, rather, in each person’s inborn ability to create or interpret received historical environments into his or her own ever more coherent and profound meaning.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur nonetheless sets out an original critique of philosophical writings, one that is restless and that prospers in many unexpected fields. If successful, this critique promises fresh insights on the ordinary uses of the word. On its first definition, “recognition” as “identifying an object or a person” would be understood to also carry a tension with the way “things themselves” appear. In its second sense, appearing in chapter 2, the “recognition of one’s own identity” would include the individual and collective capabilities that precondition the understanding of one’s self‐identity. And, finally, the third meaning of “recognition as mutual recognition,” treated in chapter 3, would include an understanding of the particular subtleties of asymmetry.<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

Abstract: Attributed to the earliest days of Islam, the apparent tradition here is to recite verses of the Quran, and then to spit or blow onto whatever is to be blessed by those verses.12. The expectoration (from the soul, into a siphon; and the clothes, the knife, your personal belongings, your ID, your passport and all of your papers).
               74The practice of blowing inspiration from the Quranic verses into clothing, knife, passport, and papers would seem to saturate the possessions of the ritual actor with sanctity, as if to shower the actor himself with a sacred vapor and drive divine grace into his person. In old school anthropology, this might have been called “contagious magic,”75but within the schemes of Tambiah, Fernandez, and Ricoeur, it is probably better understood as a thickening of the metaphorical domain the ritual actor enters by contact with the verses. The thickening of the metaphorical domain helps to transform him into a pious persona on a holy mission. Spitting Quranic verses onto tokens might also be seen as another form of supplicating/praying.<br>

Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Publisher: Murray Coombes Publishers<br>
Issue: e24805687<br>
Date: June 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Mason Garth<br>
Abstract: In this article I examine Philip Qipa (P.Q.) Vundla’s Moral Rearmament-inspired (MRA) politics with a view to explicating the previously hidden currents at work in his political activism. In my analysis, I draw on the theoretical frameworks of Paul Ricoeur and Homi Bhabha. In terms of these conceptual foundations, I investigate Vundla’s involvement in two foundational events in the history of the South African struggle, namely the school boycott of 1955 and the bus boycott of 1957. The official history of these two events, written by social historians such as Tom Lodge, interprets them as the dawn of mass opposition against apartheid. However, I contend that a closer analysis of these two events via biographical material reveals a more complex history, implicitly connected to the person of P.Q. Vundla and his politics of negotiation and finding common ground between opposing ideologies. Vundla stands out within this context because he was a nonconforming ANC leader, who disagreed with the way the party leadership approached political activism. His approach was driven by MRA values, which sought political solutions through dialogue and aimed to benefit all communities within South Africa. Vundla can be seen as an early forerunner of the bridge-building politics of Nelson Mandela. It is hoped that, by examining the role of MRA values in Vundla’s activism, a fuller, more complex account of politics in the 1950s can be arrived at.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46
