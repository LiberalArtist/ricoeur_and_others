  Author(s) WESTPHAL MEROLD<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been one of the most significant voices in Continental philosophy of religion in recent years. He, along with Paul Ricoeur, has contributed what might be called a specifically Protestant inflection to the ongoing “theological turn in phenomenology,” a movement that otherwise bears the largely Catholic accent of thinkers such as Marion, Henry, and Chrétien. Yet another contributor to this debate, the theologian David Tracy, has made a useful distinction between what he calls the “sacramental” character of the Catholic vision and the “prophetic” character of the Protestant. He sees both as complementary, the former emphasizing the more<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Abstract: Richard Kearney currently holds the Charles B. Seelig Chair in philosophy at Boston College and is visiting professor at University College Dublin. Originally from Ireland, Kearney worked closely with Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Derrida in France (he received his doctorate there under Ricoeur’s direction) and has taught in the United States for several decades. Over the years, he has labored vigorously to establish communication and conversation between many of the thinkers treated in this book (in various interviews, roundtable discussions, and other venues), but has himself also contributed significantly to the discussion of religious phenomenology and hermeneutics.

  Abstract: Since the publication of Heidegger’s
                  Being and Time, with its appeal to explicitly religious categories, phenomenology and post-phenomenological thought has repeatedly demonstrated a distinctly religious dimension. In the United States, this religious dimension to phenomenology recently has been celebrated by leading scholars such as John Caputo and Edith Wyschogrod, while, in Germany, it has been recognized by defenders and critics of phenomenology alike since the 1920s. And in France virtually every leading post-phenomenological thinker, from Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Marion to Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, has taken up and explored this dimension to phenomenology.

  Book Title: A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross-The Cruciform Self<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gregor Brian<br>
  Abstract: What does the cross, both as a historical event and a symbol of religious discourse, tell us about human beings? In this provocative book, Brian Gregor draws together a hermeneutics of the self-through Heidegger, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Taylor-and a theology of the cross-through Luther, Kierkegaard, Bonhoeffer, and Jüngel-to envision a phenomenology of the cruciform self. The result is a bold and original view of what philosophical anthropology could look like if it took the scandal of the cross seriously instead of reducing it into general philosophical concepts.<br>

  Abstract: As a result of the preceding chapter, we can see how the category of the penultimate allows us to affirm human capability yet also discern the limits of human capability and avoid a synergistic confusion of divine and human agency. The ultimate word is pronounced from beyond the self and its immanent possibilities and capacities, but within the horizon of the penultimate the self is
                  homo capax. We can therefore identify the capacities that Ricoeur discusses in his phenomenology ofl’homme capable—speaking, acting, narrating, and assuming responsibility—as penultimate capacities. If time permitted it would be worthwhile to examine<br>

  Author(s) Moberly Jennifer<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: This collection of essays, which originated in a 1996 symposium at the Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, seeks to foster a renewal of interest in political phenomenology. Eleven essays are divided into four chapters: “Basic Concepts,” “Figures,” “Fundamental Issues,” and “Race.” Not all of the essays are equally successful, and there is a great deal of variation in the degree to which each essay adheres to a phenomenological method. Yet the best of these essays make valuable contributions to political theory as such. There are clear and insightful analyses of the political thought of Husserl, Ricoeur, and Schutz. There are strong phenomenological accounts of the nature of the political actor, by Steven Crowell, and of the relationship between intersubjective experience and the community, by Adriaan Peperzak. R. Philip Buckley brings Husserl’s thoughts on politics to bear on the situation in Quebec and Robert Bernasconi contributes a fine meditation on racism. Overall, this book has value for anyone interested in political theory. It would be essential reading for anyone interested in phenomenology’s encounter with the political sphere.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, in contrast, is one of a few philosophers who offer, however briefly, a phenomenology of forgetting, although he too voices skepticism about an
         ars oblivionalison par with thears memoriae.He distinguishes between three levels or approaches to memory and forgetting. These are obstructed memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire empêchée,on the level of the psychopathological), manipulated memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire manipulée,on the practical or instrumental level), and controlled memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire commandée/obligée,on the ethical‐political level).110In the last context, forgetting and pardoning are intrinsically linked through the problematic of the past: forgetting, to memory and fidelity to the past; pardoning, to culpability and reconciliation with the past. “Indeed, a happy forgetting is the horizon of the pacified memory.”111Ricoeur further differentiates between forgetting through deletion and a more measured, reserved kind of forgetting, closely connected to the opposition between amnesia and amnesty. In considering amnesty as institutional forgetting, Ricoeur notes that it aims at reconciliation and civil peace.112In this sense one can hypothesize by analogy that persecution, punishment, and eradication, even if explicitly articulated as forgetting, may serve as institutional reminders but can also (sometimes consciously) exacerbate societal tensions.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 527832<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: Finally, there are two other authors, John M. Budd [
            6] and Luciano Floridi [35], who should be mentioned for their consideration of truth in library and information science. Budd presents perhaps the most comprehensive analysis to date exploring the intersection of philosophy and librarianship. He traces the development of relevant philosophical movements that have contributed to expanding our considerations of librarianship, and he rejects early attempts to link library and information science with positivism. Budd outlines new ways of thinking about the social and ethical actions (praxis) of librarianship by framing contemporary theoretical constructs in terms of hermeneutic phenomenology. Budd critically analyzes the works of Hans‐Georg Gadamer [36], Paul Ricoeur [37
               None–39], Martin Heidegger [40], and others to argue that “the goal of seeking knowledge, achieved through hermeneutic phenomenology, points to one thing quite clearly—that the actions we engage in LIS, including facilitating information seeking, are inseparable from being, especially as conceived by Husserl and Heidegger” [6, p. 291]. Although his work has been criticized for its uneven treatment of certain ideas and for his choice of philosophers to include or omit from the analysis [41], the study provides a broad and comprehensive examination of the ways in which contemporary philosophical movements intersect the praxis of library and information science.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Mooij J. J. A.<br>
Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the study was to explore the meaning of consolation as experienced by Job in the Book of Job and as presented in literature and how consolation relates to suffering and care. The study's theoretical design applied Ricoeur's view on phenomenology and hermeneutics. The resulting themes were as follows: consolation that is present, that originates in confrontation, that keeps suffering at a distance, that does not alleviate suffering, that originates in experience from giving comfort, and that facilitates a change of perspective. The authentic and caring consolation accepts the sufferer's incomprehensible "otherness" but however provides no answers about how to console.<br>

Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Abstract: The paper argues that Paul Ricoeur's The Philosophy of the Will retained a certain fidelity to phenomenology's early emphasis on subjectivity. When Ricoeur turned to the philosophy of language, he found a way to retain a certain emphasis on subjectivity and individuality that would make his work distinctive among other approaches to the philosophy of language. Hence, the title, Preserving the Eidetic Moment, intends to characterize Ricoeur's distinctive contribution to philosophy. The paper goes on to show how Ricoeur's approach can contribute to Critical Theory, particularly in relationship to its theory of interlocution.<br>

Abstract: In Time, Narrative, and History, David Carr argues against the narrativist claim that our lived experience does not possess the formal attributes of a story; this conclusion can be reinforced from a semiotic perspective. Our experience is mediated through temporal signs that are used again in the construction of stories. Since signs are social entities from the start, this approach avoids a problem of individualism specific to phenomenology, one which Carr takes care to resolve. A semiotic framework is also explicit about a theme Carr handles implicitly: the status of representation. Representation is internal to signification, mediating our experience not just retrospectively but prospectively in the planning and execution of action. A model is presented in which the temporal organization of experience and action is formally coordinated with the temporal organization of narrative. The model is then applied to a historical event: John Batman's attempt in 1835 to purchase land from some Aboriginal tribes around what is now Melbourne. The meaning of this event is not located only in historical writing about it but in the semiotic constitution of the event itself. Changes of meaning emerge from relations between events as new events-in this case the Australian High Court's Mabo decision-align with old ones. Finally, a number of contrasts are indicated between this model and proposals made by Arthur C. Danto, Hayden White, F. R. Ankersmit, Fernand Braudel, and Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analysis, Ricoeur continues his description via a method of active participation in the prereflective and integrally willing existence, inspired by Marcel. Although this existential analysis restores the intellectual dualism -under the influence of reflection the original unity of the incarnated Cogito falls asunder into subjective and objective thought, into spirit and matter -, nevertheless it brings to light a more subtle, ontological dualism. For there is always a tension : in the deciding existence between hesitation and choice, between a rationally considered decision and a voluntaristic haphazard dictate, in the executing existence between exertion and resistance, and in the intention of acquiescence between acceptance and refusal. Passing on from what appears before and thanks to the willing Cogito, the author concludes from these eidetic and existential descriptive results : subjectivity in general is fundamentally bipolar. The Cogito does not create (Husserl), but only inaugurates reality . The next section delineates the analysis of human fallibility. This phenomenological description at the beginning presents a strong Kantian transcendental character, so that, thus secured against subjective introspection, Ricoeur disposes of an objective guide for the notional reflection on the pre-philosophically given fallibility of the mythic „ mixture” of the soul (Plato) and of human „ misery" (Pascal). The grounds of fallibility according to Ricoeur lie in an ever unsuccessful mediation between finitude and infinity respectively in knowing, acting, and pre-eminently in feeling ; in brief, in the non-coïncidence of man with himself. The last section dedicated to an enquiry into the nature of evil commences with a purely comparative, phenomenological description of guilt-symbols confronted with psycho-analytic criticism of religion. First comes the phenomenological analysis of the primary symbols of stain, sin and guilt, in which evil is successively acknowledged „in itself”, „before God” and „before guilty self”. Then follows a morphology of the most representative myths or secondary symbols : the Babylonian cosmic myth of primitive evil, the Greek tragic myth which imputes evil to the evil god, fate and hubristic-generous man, the Jewish Adamic myth with man as bearing the chief responsability for evil, and anally the Hellenic Orphic myth which makes the body responsible for evil. Over against the neutral description of the Sacred in the phenomenology of religion Freudism places a functional interpretation, over against the inexhaustible truth of the symbol the illusion of religion, and over against the return to the Sacred the return of the repressed in the religious phenomenon. Thus the symbols lend themselves to a double interpretation : on the one side an analytic and regressive hermeneutics leading to the unconscious and on the other side a synthetic and progressive interpretation, polarized by the ultimate. Since, however, the philosopher cannot permanently entrench himself behind an attitude of neutrality with regard to the true myth, a second stage obtrudes itself, viz. an engaged description of the myths of evil. This exegesis demonstrates that the Hebrew myth of primitive fall owing to its complex structure and dialectic tensions, reaffirms the anteriority of evil from the cosmic, the fatalism of evil from the tragic and the exteriority of evil from the Orphic myth, from which the limitation of a purely ethical view of life becomes evident. For man on the one side appears as guilty in so far as he perpetrates evil and on the other side as a victim in so far as he yields to an ever-already-existing wickedness : it is the ethic-tragic conflict in the consciousness of guilt. Finally the tensions hitherto revealed in the ethic-tragic consciousness of guilt and between the hermeneutics of the phenomenology of religion and the psycho-analytic interpretation, as well as the philosophical justification of Ricoeur's betting on the primacy of the Adamic myth claim a last stage, viz. a philosophical reflection. These three charges the author wants to perform at the same time by trying to understand and elucidate fallen man „ from” the symbols and especially „from” the Jewish myth ; viz. fallen man as he appears in psycho-analysis and criminology, in political and social philosophy and history, in the rational symbols of original sin and the „servum arbitrium”. Thus in the first place there is an inquiry into the nature of Augustinian and Kantian reflective thought, which indeed elucidates man's guilt but which forgets man's connection with the totality of being, so that the author switches over to a critique of speculative thought. Dialectic speculative thought, however, undervalues the specific negativity of evil and the gratuity of reconciliation, as a consequence of which Ricceur ¡ finds himself confronted with the task of thinking a meaning-full history, in which justice is done to the contingent character of evil and salvation. 2. SOME PERSPECTIVES OF RICOEURS POETICS OR ONTOLOGY Ontological dualism as well as the ethic-tragic conflict have in Ricceur's mind no sense except from a surmised reconciliation, from a limit of unity which is the exponent of Kantian reason as a claim to intelligibility. Reason and feeling not only have an equally wide scope, but also constitute each other. For reason claims a sense that implicates a longing for total happiness, while feeling in its turn interiorizes, individualizes reason and anticipates a certain unity. But the conviction and the feeling of an ultimate unity do not constitute philosophy. Moreover the author cannot conceive the transition from the Cogito to metaphysics purely as a matter of intellectual explicitation, and certainly not of a theoretical awareness. Only by living guilt the Transcendence of a notional limit or epistemological index becomes a living Presence, Who creates freedom and liberates guilty freedom. Of this experience of Salvation there are no strict proofs but only indications. 3. SENSE OF RICOEUR'S UNFINISHED PHILOSOPHY The first section raises the question of the general nature of this philosophy. In our opinion it might most truthfully be defined as a reflective philosophy with a strong phenomenological-existential woof. For the following elements seem to be indisputably conformable to a reflective philosophy : the Marcellian active participation-method -of Biranian origin -, the description of fallible man inspired by Kant, the hermeneutics and the philosophical reflection upon the symbols, akin to Schelling, Fichte and Hegel, and finally the philosophical reflection, conceived as a rational and rigorous recuperation of a pre-established feeling which is also an heirloom of existential phenomenology. His Husserlian eidetic analysis of the neutral will has a distinctly phenomenological character ; this is also in a certain measure the case with the phenomenological description of fallibility and with the comparative and exegetic analysis of the symbols, and ultimately with the relation between philosophy and Christian belief (impossibility of a material neutrality but strict preservation of methodic autonomy). The next section attempts to define the uniqueness in Ricoeur's philosophy. A conspicuous quality of his work is the plurality of methods, so that the question rises spontaneously with the reader as to how far he is confronted with a methodic eclecticism here. Ricoeur is indeed of opinion that the philosopher cannot possibly obtain possession of his pre-comprehension with a quasi-uniform method. According to us it is his very patiently and stubbornly maintained strife for a rationally strict and coherent recuperation of his Christian experience of existence that induces him either to the application of another approach to promote the same pre-comprehensive datum to a more profound intelligibility, or to the transition to another domain of experience with a method adapted to it. Inevitably this pluriform method involves a certain voluminous explicitation of his experience of life which concurs with a reflective philosophy which in tracing human authenticity will apply the results of all the humanities, and at the same time agrees with an existential philosophy for which the road to be covered is an essential and indispensable factor in the gradual, historic becoming aware of rationality in philosophizing itself. Ricoeur's strict watch for coherence and systematization is evident not only from the thorough justification of each change of method and from the fidelity to his methodic agreements made before, but in particular from the notion of limit which plays an exceptionally important rôle in his philosophy. By nature a limit limits, but in limiting it bases and justifies the limited. Thus Ricceur seems to understand his manifold methods and view-points from a higher, personal aspect, i.e. from a richly differentiated, broadly elaborated and consciously limited and historical rationality, so that in our opinion there can in his case only be question of an eclecticism in a more brilliant sense. Perhaps Ricoeur's philosophy might be defined as a reflective philosophy of limits which implicates an overstepping of dogmatism and relativism and at the same time includes rigorous rationality and existential depth, consequently as a harmony of French and German genius. The last section finally tries to settle the question that is Ricoeur himself. Which are the possibilities and the chances of a wider spiritual development and of a more social, national and international justice for human liberty, proud, but deeply wounded by greed, ambition and lust of power ? What, considering the full power of evil, is the man and the God of such a history ? Ricoeur's question however is inseparably also practical : what can and must I do for the spiritual and material progress of man ? Ricoeur's astounding activity at congresses and meetings bears witness to this and most of all his personal interferences in delicate questions such as pacifism, decolonisation and Algeria. Thinking and acting, reflection and praxis border on each other but in this way also found, re-create and fertilize each other.<br>

Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from it.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, provedeno je kao studija slučaja empirijsko istraživanje mladenačke službe božje u mega crkvama Južne Koreje. Korejsko je sluèaj važan jer Koreja predstavlja jednu od najjaèih kršèanskih populacija u svijetu, dok je s druge strane izložena izazovima kao što je primjerice pad broja mladih vjernika i ogromni generacijski jaz u njezinim crkvenim kongregacijama. Razmatranje mladenačkih kongregacija u sedam mega crkava u Seulu i tekstuaina analiza mladenačke službe božje s težištem na glazbu pruža informacije kóje povezuju filozofske rasprave o teologiji glazbe s pitanjem identiteta uključenog u hermeneutiku glazbene prakse u crkvama. Semiotièki prístup glazbenoj analizi prihvaèen je kao korisno sredstvo za povezivanje ovih empirijskih podataka s njihovim filozofijskim interpretacijama i za ispitivanje glazbene štruktúre i narativne štruktúre tekstova.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgment (1991, 38–39)? And is not the persuasion that moves people to act a critical means of continuing the spiraling process of interpretation and action? In my view, catharsis alone—while often necessary—cannot create the same kind of raw material necessary for the movement from mimesis1to mimesis2; it can only create the conditions of possibility for human action. A change in one's state of mind cannot easily be translated into the media of memory, whether the memory takes the form of a monument, speech, or biography. What we describe as “memory” is such because it intends to orient us toward future public actions, such as remembering, protesting, voting, speaking, writing policies, and so on. A rhetorical approach insists that memories are important because they can produce identification and public action rather than just an individual change of mind.<br>

Abstract: Although Shaw may be many admirable things, he is not a university-trained philosopher of hermeneutics and phenomenology. Ricoeur is. Yet when it comes to contemplating matters of faith and hope, little of consequence, if anything, separates the two, in terms of both substance and method. To begin with, the first presupposition Shaw employs to orient himself to existence is the same as Ricoeur's: the unsullied innocence of creation. Every infant, according to Shaw, is an “experiment … a fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfect: that is, to make humanity divine.”
         
               Each child, Shaw says, possesses a “divine spark,” a “vital impulse” that impels it “towards perfection.”38
            
               In all children, then, latent divinity lies dormant, awaiting cultivation by the guardians of civilization. In other words, the good toward which the budding vanguards of the future instinctively aspire is not wholly outside them. It also lives within them: it is encoded on the helical strands of their DNA.39
            
               For Shaw, the deific imprint of all that is virtuous and consecrated in the world inheres uncorrupted in the human genome.40<br>
