  Abstract: The most persuasive moment of Paul Ricoeur’s work for the development anthropologist is his idea of narrative imagination. This concept, applied to the development act of working together with the other who faces marginalization, fear, famine, and isolation, provides a medium for both the anthropologist and the local to emplot history and fiction into a social reality that brings each to a new place. Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

Abstract: According to Paul Ricoeur, the abolition of the literal interpretation in the metaphorical statement gives rise to a reinterpretation of reality itself.
         48Recalling Aristotle’s paradoxical claim that tragic poetry pre‐sents the essence of human action through the creation of a fictitious plot ormuthos(thatmimesisandmuthosare brought together in the activity of tragicpoesis),49Ricoeur maintains that the reinterpretation called forth by metaphorical discourse is at once imaginative and imitative, fresh and creative, and yet true to the reality that is metaphorically described.<br>

Abstract: An example of refiguration is the capacity to make a narrative or invent a new plot from the same events but to lead to different actions; for example, a person who reads a book may subsequently refigure important events in her life to achieve a new synthesis involving connections not made before. Ricoeur emphasizes that the spiral of narrative making is endless because we are able to “carry the mediation past the same point a number of times, but at different altitudes” [
         14, p. 72]. Hence, reauthoring involves taking an active part in the authorship of our own lives.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: What is left, then, of memory's scope and power? one might ask. How to handle the flow of memory and oblivion, the lengthy stretches of desire, the postponement of fulfillment, of the “tomorrow, tomorrow” versus the instantaneous pressure of the present: “Why not now? Why not now an end to my impure life in this very hour?”?
      
            Only the verticality of oblivion:17
         
            Now, there is no denying that this text sounds utterly seducing, expressing longing and desire, falling short and finding fulfillment all at once. As such, it can be called representative of the pulse of the Augustinian language. Yet putting things this way would fail to do justice to the tight nature of
               
         Sero te amavi, late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new:sero te amavi,late have I loved you. And see, you were within and I was in the external world and sought you there, and in my unlovely state I plunged into those lovely created things which you made. You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.

               confessioas it is governed by the tight notion of temporality: the “now” of conversion that, albeit shunned in a lengthy process of procrastination, is not capable of not being felt, heard, touched, and smelled at any moment. All that leaves us with an aporetic situation. While Ricoeur's approximation between time and eternity appeared still based on a linear concept of temporality whose vicissitudes lasted until final rest was to be found (thus allowing narrative d~<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur delineates how self-relatedness is implied in domains of speech, action, narra-
tion, and communal (institutional) interaction — in speech by the use of performatives (prom-
ises, assertions, déclarations) which refer to the integrity (tnistworthiness) of the speaker; in
action by the fact that acts are not simply events in the world but présupposé agency and re-
sponsibility; in narration by the subtle dialectics between character and plot, a dialectic in
which the narrating self aims at coherence of the I-self relationship over time; and, at the
communal level, because larger communal wholes (institutions) maintain their moral identity
only in the openness to otherness.<br>

Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur identifies three ways in which the mediating function of mimesis
      2operates in the configuration of narratives. First, configuration mediates between the individual event and the story as a whole by assigning an event a place of significance in the unfolding of a plot. Let us take, for instance, a book from the aforementioned Americans All series. Lillie Patterson's 1970Martin Luther King, Jr.: Man of Peace, which was awarded the first Coretta Scott King Book Award for African American children's literature, begins with an anecdote from King's childhood. This story narrates King's supposed first encounter with the “wall” of racism. When he enters school, his white friends are no longer allowed to play with him. He persists in seeking their company but is rebuffed: “Finally, their mother tried to tell Martin why. ‘You see, you are colored and they are white’” (Patterson 1970, 10). Unsatisfied, Martin goes to his own mother, who explains the history of slavery and its effects on their lives. She concludes by reminding her son that despite this past, “You are as good as anyone” (Patterson 1970, 10–12). As the opening scene, this vignette both introduces King as a child (creating an identificatory link with readers) and frames the remaining story about a confident man who worked to break down that “wall” of racism. Second, configuration joins and relates disparate aspects of the story, including various agents, actions, motivations, and outcomes. Patterson's text, for example, emphasizes both King's personal ambition and his cooperation with others. Members of his family play a key role, and the appearance of his wife, Coretta Scott, warrants an entire chapter (Patterson 1970, 33–38). Their marriage is represented not as mere love story but as the collaboration between two powerful social agents. The narrator explains that in accepting marriage to King, “Coretta decided to join the young minister and share his dream” (Patterson 1970, 37). Finally, configura~<br>

Abstract: To make things worse, the allied victors ignored his advocacy of a just and merciful peace treaty at the conclusion of World War I, so that the vanquished would not plot murderous revenge. Regrettably, because of this colossal myopia, the defeated did precisely what Shaw foresaw and, to our everlasting sorrow, six million souls went to the ovens amid the carnage of the Second World War (not to mention the fiery mushroom clouds that incinerated much of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Everywhere his discerning eye turned, Shaw saw outrages perpetrated against the sanctity of the person and the integrity of the planet. This is not the stuff sanguine dreams are made of. Ironically, through it all Shaw did manage to achieve a degree of stature for his feverish efforts on behalf of a beleaguered humankind, but it was not the kind of prominence he sought. Popular opinion regarded him more as a witty jester who reduced everything to a pointless joke than as an earnest prophet who conveyed providential correctives to a wayward people. Commonly perceived as a master of the frivolous, he was not taken seriously as an artist or thinker until relatively late in life. No. Events did not transpire according to Shaw's preferences, to put it mildly. Yet Shaw never succumbed to the enticements of fashionable nihilism or the futility of abject negativity. He could hold competing conceptions in his mind without suffering the disquieting dissonance that frequently accompanies analytical thinking.<br>
