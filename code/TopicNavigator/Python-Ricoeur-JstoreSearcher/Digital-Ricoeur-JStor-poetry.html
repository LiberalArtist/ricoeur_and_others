  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

Abstract: According to Paul Ricoeur, the abolition of the literal interpretation in the metaphorical statement gives rise to a reinterpretation of reality itself.
         48Recalling Aristotle’s paradoxical claim that tragic poetry pre‐sents the essence of human action through the creation of a fictitious plot ormuthos(thatmimesisandmuthosare brought together in the activity of tragicpoesis),49Ricoeur maintains that the reinterpretation called forth by metaphorical discourse is at once imaginative and imitative, fresh and creative, and yet true to the reality that is metaphorically described.<br>

Article Title: Gefährliche Perspektiven: Zum Metaphernbegriff bei Hugo Friedrich<br>
Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30161639<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wiegmann Reinhilde<br>
Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>
