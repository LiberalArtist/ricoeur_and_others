Journal Title: The Journal of Religion<br>
Article Title: The Identity of the Literal Sense: Midrash in the Work of Hans Frei<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: In
         Types of Christian Theology, as in much of his later work, Frei’s primary conversation partners are Frank Kermode and Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur, as the foremost advocate of a hermeneutics of understanding, and Kermode, as a literary critic who refuses esoteric or figural interpretation, both render problematic the literal sense as Frei understands it. As Frei says on numerous occasions, the literal sense of scripture is best understood as taking the text to mean what it says, with the caveat that the text means what the community agrees that it says. As we shall see, in both its pluralism and its interpretive potency, this is a far more complex claim than is frequently assumed, and it can be best understood via contrast with Ricoeur’s approach.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53
            
               Thus, in addition to whatever else they do, insist~<br>
