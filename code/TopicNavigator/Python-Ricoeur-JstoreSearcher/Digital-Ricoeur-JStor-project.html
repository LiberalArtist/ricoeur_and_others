  A Resource for the Theology of Nature and Grace? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgfxw">Recognizing the Gift</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter continues the exploration of the problem of the gift in continental philosophy. In particular, it turns to the work of the philosopher Paul Ricoeur as a resource for reformulating Marion’s concept of a gift in such a way as to answer the criticisms posed by Milbank and Tanner while retaining important parts of the overall project. Ricoeur notably brings forward a conception of
                  recognitionthat is underdeveloped in Marion’s work and that serves as a key corrective. Though Ricoeur was an older contemporary of Marion’s and the two had common interlocutors, such as Emmanuel Levinas and David Tracy,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgg3z">Engaging Bonhoeffer</a><br>
  Author(s) Moberly Jennifer<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: How can reason and sensibility fit together? What would be an adequate anthropology for capturing the essential unity of our humanity? For a full-fledged philosophical account of the tensile and delicate unity of the primordial human condition, I propose that we turn to Paul Ricoeur’s philosophical anthropology in his unjustly neglected early masterpiece,
                  Fallible Man(1960).¹ The book was written as part of a vaster project that Ricoeur named philosophy of the will and that was initiated with an impressive study of the phenomenological structures of the will, entitledThe Voluntary and the Involuntary(1950), and followed by the two-part<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Other recognition theories, in particular those of Hegel and his followers, have explored important insights regarding the integration of recognition into knowledge. If these insights are right, grasping an object with a concept would engage one’s thoughts in a self‐recognition project that is arguably in line with the “lived experiences” referred to by Ricoeur. The section dealing with the “ruins of representation” misses the opportunity to show how to reconstruct knowledge claims on these ruins. On the one hand, one could argue that a theory of knowledge would simply be sided with a compatible theory of recognition. On the other hand, neo‐Hegelians, such as Robert B. Brandom, would press for profound changes in the way that theories of knowledge are to be understood. It is left to the reader to locate the hermeneutical analysis of Ricoeur in this debate.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: In this revised dissertation, W. David Hall argues that Paul Ricoeur’s religious writings can offer an important context for interpreting his philosophical project—that, in fact, Ricoeur’s philosophical writings take on more of a theological tenor over time, especially if one focuses on their growing emphasis on ethics. This development, Hall argues, culminates in a creative tension between love and justice that finds its peak in a confrontation between the ideas of autonomy and theonomy. “The love command lends an imperative structure to the ideal of love that opens it to moral judgment in general and ideals of justice in particular” (2), yet without turning into something reducible to the Kantian notion of a moral categorical imperative. Rather, what is at issue is a “poetic” use of the imperative in Ricoeur’s thought.<br>

Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Author(s): SCOTT-BAUMANN ALISON<br>
Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

to precisely what Ricoeur implies with his statement: "What is surprising is that this inter-
lacing of fiction and history in no way undercuts the project of standing-for belonging to
history, but instead helps to realize it; 0:186). Giambattista Vico's fanciful division of
universal history into four periods, associated with the tropes of metaphor, synecdoche,
metonymy, and irony (in Scienze Nuova (1744, third édition), par. 400-411), is the
apparent source of this peculiar categorial framework adopted by Kenneth Burke and
(altered) Northrop Frye. Hayden White claims these tropes are the 'transformational
system built into Foucault's conception of the succession of forms of the human sciences,
even though Foucault appears not to know that it is there.'! Cf. Hayden V. White, 'Foucault

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Abstract: A obra de Ricoeur constitui certamente uma contribuição importantc para o pensamento contemporâneo. Todavia, possui postulados metafísicos que limitam o alcance do seu projecto filosófico e religioso. A repetição de uma tese fundamental de Ricoeur tem a pretensão de desbloquear e de superar este limite. /// S'il est hors de doute que l'oeuvre de Ricoeur constitue une contribution importante pour la pensée contemporaine, néanmoins la présence en elle de postulats métaphysiques a pour effet de limiter la portée de son projet philosophique et religieux. La reprise d'une thése fondamentale et particuliérement révélatrice de Ricoeur a pour but de débloquer cette situation et de ces limites. /// No one can doubt Ricoeur's contribution to contemporary thought. However, the presence of metaphysical postulates in his work limit the potential originality of his philosophical and religious project. Through the repetition of an especially fundamental thesis, the author of this article attempts to overcome this limit.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that, at this point, Janicaud's argument still remains incomplete. He has suggested that phenomenology can and should be transformed in order to accommodate Deleuzian insights. But why wouldn't hermeneutics be the discourse by which this passage from Deleuze to phenomenology is made? If the worry has to do with Deleuze's suspicions of its priestly residues, why couldn't one perform a transformation of the hermeneutical project similar to Janicaud's transformation of the phenomenological project?
         
               In light of these questions, I want to construct what I would imagine to be, if not Ricoeur's own view, at least a Ricoeurian reply whose aim is to show that hermeneutics provides the resources needed for carrying out Janicaud's minimal phenomenology.20<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Ricoeur's understanding of “appropriation.” One of the advantages of Ricoeur's formulation is that it recognizes the significance of readerly agency while not relying on the idea of a self-possessed subject. Ricoeur argues that appropriation should not be understood as a function of a sovereign subject who “would possess the key” to understanding. Rather, the reader of a text “exchange[s] the
         me,masterof itself, for theself,discipleof the text” (Ricoeur 2007, 37). Such a reader does not project him- or herself onto the text but receives “an enlarged self from the apprehension of proposed worlds which are the genuine object of interpretation” (Ricoeur1981, 182). The ability to perform this function depends on what Ricoeur calls “second-order reference,” which requires the reader to suspend concerns with whether the events “really” happened in order fully to understand the world opening up through her or his imaginative engagement with the text (Ricoeur1977, 216–56).
               This “world of the work” that reveals itself before the text becomes the referent of fictional narrative. When engaged in interpretation, then, the reader should seek to understand this “proposed world” as one “which I could inhabit and in which I could project my ownmost possibilities” (Ricoeur 2007, 36). Fictional narratives, then, ultimately create an imagined world that prepares readers to act their way into it, so to speak. In13
            Time and Narrative, Ricoeur explains that historical narrative employs a related but distinct “referential mode”: whereas fiction refers to an imagined world that could potentially be enacted in front of it, so to speak, historical narrative also claims to refer to an actual world that already exists behind it (1984, 1:82). Ricoeur productively blurs these distinctions inMemory, History, Forgetting, explaining that both types of narrative enable the reader to inhabit the “world of the text” (2004, 262).<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
