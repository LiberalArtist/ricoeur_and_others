  Abstract: What is Phenomenology? Externally considered, it is a philosophical movement that originated in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth century, found its classic inspiration in the sustained work of Edmund Husserl, and developed in differing ways in thinkers like Max Scheler, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty, more recently in Paul Ricoeur and Hans-Georg Gadamer and most recently in figures like Jean-Luc Marion. It continues to have wide impact in such diverse areas as the philosophy of physical science and mathematics, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, legal theory, economics, history, literature, political science, linguistics, anthropology, aesthetics, and religion.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: Three epigraphs circumscribe the book’s broader themes. The first, from the late philosopher Paul Ricoeur (LaCocque’s friend and collaborator), identifies the role of myth in combining the innocence and guilt of humanity. The second, from Norman Brown’s
      Life against Death, points out how “pyramids and skyscrapers” represent a “flight from death.” The third, from Jacques Derrida, characterizes the Tower of Babel as “an incompletion, the impossibility of finishing, of totalizing” (v). Taken together, these three reflections affirm an understanding of the Babel story as a timeless “symbol of all our constructions and fabrications, with their inexorable outcome: confusion (of our life messages) and scattering (of all the pieces of our projects)” (21). They also provide a model for LaCocque’s own scholarly practice, which is distinctively rigorous yet exploratory at the same time. If, for example, Genesis 11 dates from the exile, it then becomes possible to depict it as a mythic critique of architectural fetishism and political ambition. The “gate of the divine” (Bab-El) thus becomes a dangerous threshold from profane to sacred, one in which the desire to “make a name” reflects an arrogance doomed to confuse all names. As myth, Genesis 11 captures enduring tendencies in human psychology such as infants’ fascination with presence and absence (“fort” and “da”) and the politics of empire.<br>

Article Title: Is Culture a Problem for Social Psychology?<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: irqr.2008.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 05 2008<br>
Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Abstract: This article summarizes the claims of Owen Flanagan that psychology can make important criticisms of and viable contributions to both religious and philosophical ethics. Flanagan insists that both fields of ethics should pass the test of what he calls the Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism (PMPR). However, in order for Flanagan to escape naïve naturalism, his PMPR test should be used within a hermeneutic philosophy such as that of Paul Ricoeur. Ricoeur's concepts of "diagnosis" and "distanciation" can help the moral theologian find a limited but important role for PMPR.<br>

Article Title: "Recognition Is a Form of Agreement": The Workings of Self-Narration in "The Catcher in the Rye" and "Invisible Man"<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: Two theoretical models of hope dominate the research field in psychology. The first, most closely associated with C. R. Snyder, conceptualizes hope as a cognitive construct centered on the dual capacities of individuals to strive toward personally relevant goals despite obstacles and to formulate strategies for pursuing their desired ends over time.
         
               This approach is cognitive because it anchors the hope process in conscious intellectual activity such as willing, thinking, reasoning, and problem solving. For Snyder, “hope is the sum of the mental willpower and waypower that you have for your goals.”10
            
               The second major paradigm, most closely associated with Anthony Scioli and Henry B. Biller, conceptualizes hope as a future-directed emotional construct with network attributes comprising four complex and interrelated subsystems.11
            
               This approach is emotional because it ties the positive expectations of individuals to humankind's inborn animating passion for mastery (autonomy/empowerment), attachment (bonds with others), survival, and spirituality (the four subsystems). Under this view, hope is a near universal phenomenon with a deep structure rooted in the biological, psychological, and cultural evolution of the species. For Scioli and Biller, an integrative theory like theirs captures “the entire breadth, depth, and richness of the hope experience” more so than other efforts.12
