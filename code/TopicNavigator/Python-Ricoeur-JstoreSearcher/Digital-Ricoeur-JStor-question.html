  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these <br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 6 we saw that the cruciform self is not a punctual self. In this chapter I demonstrate the sense in which the cruciform self is a capable self, since capability is one of the central themes of philosophical anthropology. On Ricoeur’s definition, capability is a power or potentiality that the self is able to exercise—most basically, “the power to cause something to happen.”¹ So our question is this: What place do human agency and the power to act have in the life of faith?

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have raised the question of gift and recognition as a resource for the theology of nature and grace. Jean-Luc Marion’s careful analysis of the gift and the saturated phenomenon offers valuable insights while also making overtures to theology, but it falls short on some key points, particularly its denial of reciprocity and underdeveloped notion of recognition. Paul Ricoeur’s work, as I have explained, offers correctives to Marion’s by pairing a less-developed notion of gift with a stronger account of recognition and reciprocity.

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Abstract: A theory of genre that will produce certainty about the real nature of literary works must await an answer to the question, “How is language possible?” Current theories that treat language “scientifically” in the narrow sense, as an object among other objects, must fail to deal adequately with the consciousness of meaning in the speaking and understanding subject. Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur turns to Walzer’s work, then, not to move from a Rawlsian liberalism to communitarianism but to look at another question: that of the divisibility of principles of justice within a particular state. Again Ricoeur emphasizes the importance of political community. He thinks Walzer errs in viewing the question of politics solely as a question of the just distribution of political power since, in doing so, he fails to examine the status of the political community within which distributions proceed. Ricoeur acknowledges the attention Walzer pays to questions of membership in a political community. Still, he thinks that what Walzer’s work illuminates is “the uncomfortable situation of an entity called upon to behave at the same time as the whole and as the part, as the container and the contained, as inclusive agency and an included region” (p. 93). Rather than moving to a more communitarian view, then, Ricoeur accepts a modified version of Rawlsian liberalism: Rawls successfully constructs a single set of principles of justice, and we need only recognize that the grounds for this selection lie in our preexisting conception of the good rooted in our aspirations for meaningful lives and friendships within just institutions.<br>

Author(s): DeBevoise M B <br>
Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur captures this dynamism, arguing that “narrative identity thus becomes the name of a problem at least as much as it is that of a solution” [
         30, p. 179]. In other words, there is a constant question to be answered: Who? We act on that question from the perspective of our position in history and culture, that is, from within the circle of interpretation, which can be construed as a world of action with temporality in the form of traditions, and ongoing practices in the form of fields of action [15].<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question <br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In this chapter, Ricoeur displays an artful capacity to inspire the ongoing research on recognition. Many contemporary thinkers have chosen to shun the troubling question of “What is it that must be recognized?” with something akin to an institutional approach: the answer would not lie in discovering the essence of recognition but, instead, in finding a creative approach to the negotiation of recognition claims. This approach is clearly the one preferred in the defense of multiculturalism. For instance, Will Kymlicka emphasizes the design of fair “structures of culture” that are distinguished from substantial “characters of culture” (Will Kymlicka,
      Liberalism, Community, and Culture[New York: Clarendon, 1989], 167). The idea behind this separation of political from more substantive problems is, most of the time, congruent with considerations about the pluralism of worldviews and the public role of philosophy. Yet this approach, however sound it may be, has displaced deep conflicts in the hands of institutional “designs” that are guided by the need for immediate results, which are likely to shade important issues.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the <br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of<br>

Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Abstract: If Descartes's "Cogito" can be held as the opening of the era of modern subjectivity, it is to the extent that the "I" is taken for the first time in the position of foundation, i.e., as the ultimate condition for the possibility of all philosophical discourse. The question raised in this paper is whether the crisis of the "Cogito", opened later by Hume, Nietzsche and Heidegger on different philosophical grounds, is not already contemporaneous to the very positing of the "Cogito".<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Abstract: My aim in this memorial paper is to recall two essential Ricoeurean themes that underlie his entire philosophical orientation and that respond well to specific challenges today from postmodern deconstruction. At question is whether Ricoeur's account of sign in language and the living present in time can adequately respond to and meet the recent challenge from postmodern deconstruction, which radically challenges the very root of his phenomenological and hermeneutic orientation: the priority of the semantic in language and the priority of the living present. Although Ricoeur and Derrida will be seen to address the same problems of decentering consciousness, their accounts, although agreeing on importnat issues, quickly become mutually exclusive and deconstruction becomes a challenge to Ricoeurean hermeneutics. I will turn first to the postmodern deconstruction of Jacques Derrida before turning to Ricoeur's response with a more viable view of language, sense, and lived time.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

The question of ultimacy and the validity of the symbolic is considered through the views of Paul Ricoeur and Carl Jung.<br>

Abstract: I will investigate in this paper what kind of "Weltanschauung" Freud suggests. Although Freud argues in the lecture XXXV, "The Question of a "Weltanschauung" (1933)," that psychoanalysis is incapable of creating a "Weltanschauung" of its own, I think that he has a certain "Weltanschauung", i.e., the aesthetic worldview, which involves his scientific, psychoanalytic, and artistic principles. Furthermore, I will explicate that Freud's aesthetic worldview is ultimately related to the "Weltanschauungen" of William James and Paul Ricoeur. I will focus particularly on their terms, "sympathetic" and "poetic," which are the crucial elements that constitute the aesthetic "Weltanschauung". Finally, I will briefly present my intention in drawing this aesthetic "Weltanschauung". I will conclude that throughout the aesthetic "Weltanschauung" we may accept that everything is precious, pertinent, and worthy to be viewed as a part and a whole, and as home (Heim).<br>

Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R.

Abstract: This article presents a variety of philosophical answers to the age old question: unde malum - where does evil come from? Starting with the metaphysical responses of Augustine, Hegel and Kant, it proceeds to examine some more recent approaches - Lyotard, Kristeva and Zizek - in terms of the 'postmodern sublime'. He concludes by proposing a 'hermeneutic' response to the problem, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, which seeks to address the question in terms of narrative understanding and practical action. /// O presente artigo apresenta uma série de respostas filosóficas à imemorial questão: unde malum - qual a origem do mal? Partindo das respostas metafísicas de Santo Agostinho, Hegel e Kant, o autor examina depois algumas das abordagens mais recentes ao problema - Lyotard, Kristeva e Zizek - em termos do 'sublime pós-moderno', O artigo conclui com uma proposta 'hermenêutica 'para o problema, proposta essa inspirada no pensamento de Paul Ricoeur e cujo objectivo é elucidar a questão do mal em termos de uma compreensão narrativa e de acção prática.<br>

Abstract: La psychanalyse freudienne est de bout en bout interprétation ; Freud établit des règles pour l'interprétation, il donne une clé herméneutique, et ébranle et met en mouvement les interprétations existantes que l'homme donne de soi-même et du monde. D'autre part il est remarquable que l'oeuvre de Freud est inconnue et méconnue dans la littérature herméneutique. P. Ricoeur est le premier qui ait compris qu'on ne peut pas se passer de Freud comme interlocuteur lors de la discussion sur l'herméneutique. Freud fonctionne, selon Ricoeur, comme démystificateur. Il démasque les illusions. Une seconde lecture de Freud est la remise en question des intentions réductrices. Dans son essai sur Freud la réflexion, l'interprétation comprise comme réduction de l'illusion, et l'interprétation entendue comme restauration du sens constituent une unité dialectique. Mais schatten. Of hij echter van de echte wijsgerige intentie veel begrepen heeft kan men betwijfelen. Ricoeur ne parle jamais de l'acte psychanalytique ou du dialogue psychanalytique en tant que tel. C'est pour cette raison que la vraie portée de la découverte freudienne se perd probablement. Dans l'acte psychanalytique il se révèle que l'homme est situé dans un langage et dans un discours transindividuel. Un discours qui est en même temps présentation, objectivation, identification, apologie, provocation, frustration et aliénation. Le langage, selon Lacan, a une primauté sur le sujet parlant et le discours transindividuel est irréductible. La primauté du langage et du discours, considérée comme irréductible peut changer et éclairer d'une façon toute nouvelle les questions fondamentales de l'herméneutique actuelle.<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les principaux aspects de la définition et de la compréhension « aristotélicienne » de la métaphore ont été mis en question: théorie de la substitution, teleologie de l'univocité, subordination de la métaphore à la connaissance, et jusqu'à la centralité même conférée à la métaphore aux dépens d'autres figures (métonymie, synecdoque, catachrèse. .. ). Dans cet article, nous tentons de résumer et de discuter les points essentiels de cette contestation multiforme, en nous attachant particulièrement à la déconstruction derridienne de la métaphore « dans le texte philosophique » et à la synthèse, par Ricoeur, de la « nouvelle » théorie de la métaphore. In the second half of the twentieth century, the main aspects of the « aristotelian » definition and understanding of metaphor have been questioned : substitution-theory, teleology of univocity, subordination of metaphor to knowledge, and the very centrality attributed to metaphor at the expense of other tropes (metonymy, synecdoque, catachresis...). In this paper, we try to summarize and discuss various aspects of this dispute, paying special attention to Derrida's deconstruction of metaphor « in the philosophical text » and to Ricoeur's synthesis of the « new » theory of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'attèle à montrer comment les notions principales de l'herméneutique de Ricœur (monde du texte/monde du lecteur, distanciation – appropriation, compréhension de soi trois mimèsis) ont permis de penser de façon systématique la question du statut du texte biblique et de sa traduction dans un mémoire de licence de la Faculté de théologie de Neuchâtel, réalisé en 2006. Après une présentation du mémoire et de son contexte, les apports de la pensée de Ricœur sont énumérés en quatre points : la théorie de la traduction, la notion de lecture non utilisatrice, la notion de canon et celle de «texte inspiré». This article sets out to show how the principal notions of Ricoeur's hermeneutics (the textual world/the reader's world, distantiation - appropriation, self-comprehension, three mimesis) made possible a systematic exposition of the question of the status of biblical text and its translation in a licentiate thesis at the Faculty of Theology of Neuchâtel, in 2006. Once the thesis and its context are presented, the contributions of Ricoeur's ideas are enumerated in four points: translation theory, the notions of nonuser readings, of canonicity, and of «inspired text».<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Abstract: Le but de cette intervention est de mettre en dialogue les pensées de Paul Ricœur et de Gerhard Ebeling à partir du concept de parole efficace. La première partie entreprend de montrer, notamment à travers les lectures ricœuriennes d'Ebeling dans les années 1960 et 1980, que le théologien allemand est plus «barthien» que le philosophe français en ce qui concerne le mouvement herméneutique de la distanciation. Dans la seconde partie, question se pose, à travers une confrontation plus indirecte entre les deux auteurs, de savoir dans quelle mesure Ricœur est plus «barthien» qu'Ebeling par rapport au mouvement contraire de l'appropriation. Dans sa conclusion, l'auteur avance la thèse selon laquelle Ebeling serait plus cohérent que Ricœur dans sa réflexion autour de la parole efficace. The aim of this essay is to juxtapose the thinking of Paul Ricoeur and Gerhard Ebeling on the basis of the concept of efficient word. The first part, notably through Ricoeur's reading of Ebeling, tries to show that in the 1960's-80's, the German theologian was more «Barthian» than the French philosopher on the topic of the hermeneutical movement of detachment. The second part, by a more indirect confrontation between the two writers, poses the question to what degree Ricoeur is more «Barthian» that Ebeling on the opposite movement of appropriation. The article concludes with the theory that Ebeling is more coherent than Ricoeur in his thinking about efficient word.<br>

Article Title:  أسطورة الخلق في شرق أفريقيا / The Myth of Creation in East Africa <br>
Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: The second result of this article, as I see it, is more speculative in nature, to the extent that it goes a little further than anything that either Ricoeur or Janicaud has explicitly said. Janicaud gives up the metaphysical ambitions of phenomenology to establish itself as a first philosophy, which leads the phenomenologist to be characterized rightly as a despot, or if taking a theological turn, a priest. But if a minimal phenomenology leads in a new direction, then what transformation of the phenomenologist's role would follow? What figure, in other words, would come to characterize the work of the minimal phenomenologist? Drawing from work that I have developed elsewhere, I can think of no better answer to this question than the figure of the translator, or to be even more precise, the code-switcher.

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Hyperboles are a contextual response to an exigence just as much as they are a way of perceiving and approaching meaning and being in general. Often creating intense
         affectusin the audience, Johnson suggests, “the hyperbolist perceives an extraordinary, outrageous, ridiculous, or ineffableres(thing, event, feeling, idea), while his or herverba(words, speech, language) strain discursive limits, analogical frameworks, and literary and rhetorical conventions, to represent thatres” (2010, 2). Here Johnson indicates that one would not use hyperbole or adopt a hyperbolic perspective unless the magnitude of some event or experience called for and justified its use. To be sure, those such as Levinas are responding to an extraordinary, contextualized experience or event, though it may not be readily apparent that their response is a hyperbolic one, and so the next question for hyperbole thus becomes one of intent. It is often presumed that hyperbole must be intentional, but as Ricoeur and Webb indicate, that is not necessarily the case, since one may be engaging in a practice of excess in philosophical argumentation in response to some extraordinary exigence without being fully aware that one is assuming a hyperbolic mode of thought.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>
