  Author(s) CHRÉTIEN JEAN-LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: We may certainly speak of a second generation of French phenomenologists, and perhaps also a third, if we count among the first Emmanuel Lévinas, Michel Henry, and Paul Ricoeur; among the second Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Jean-Louis Chrétien, and Didier Franck; and among the third Claude Romano, myself, and others. In reality, a difference in context marks the distance between these different generations. The first generation, which developed in the aftermath of World War II, remained closely tied to the works of Husserl<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The most persuasive moment of Paul Ricoeur’s work for the development anthropologist is his idea of narrative imagination. This concept, applied to the development act of working together with the other who faces marginalization, fear, famine, and isolation, provides a medium for both the anthropologist and the local to emplot history and fiction into a social reality that brings each to a new place. Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

  Author(s) Louth Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The focus of this chapter and the next is the functioning of religious language and the role played therein by metaphor. The task is to consider the properties by which metaphor undertakes the “redescription of reality” with which Ricoeur credits it. To navigate this major current in his thought, we will proceed in three stages. In this chapter, we introduce the “linguistic turn” and then follow the course of Ricoeur’s exegetical works to gain an appreciation of how his general theory of metaphoricity relates specifically to religious discourse: that is, the way in which the scriptural naming of God functions<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Popkin defines such autobiographies as published personal narratives in which professional historians discuss first and foremost their lives. His corpus includes close to four hundred book‐length and shorter texts by Western historians—essentially Americans and Europeans. Following Paul Ricoeur, Popkin emphasizes the literary autonomy of autobiography. While it shares traits with history and fiction, this “hybrid genre” alone brings together “an unstable mixture of fabulation and actual experience,” an independence from documentation, an investigation into “the inner experience of time,” a lack of closure, and an ability to supplement reality through rhetorical transformation (45, 47).<br>

Article Title: Translating Time: The Nature and Function of Joseph Smith’s Narrative Canon<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: This tensional approach enables new possibilities for the field. As David Jasper recognizes, literature is no longer (to quote John Wesley) the “handmaid of piety” (5). Accordingly, the field is not limited to art and literature that are explicitly theological or religious, nor is it limited to literature and theology within the Christian traditions. Literature can now both instruct and deconstruct theology. For Jasper, theology is no longer tenable without literature. Invoking Emmanuel Lévinas as well as Ricoeur, Hass helps us to understand why: theology needs the apophatic power of metaphor to redescribe reality and to confront the other that cannot be reduced to any single discipline. Alana Vincent reminds us that this is not easy, nor is this work ever done, but this is what makes the work so valuable. Interdisciplinary inquiry confronts us with insurmountable uncertainties and ambiguities, but these challenges are constructive opportunities to reflect upon the limits of our knowledge, our boundaries, and our disciplines.<br>

Article Title: Teacher education for Muslim women: Intercultural relationships, method and philosophy<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23881003<br>
Date: 6 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): SCOTT-BAUMANN ALISON<br>
Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Article Title: DOSTOEVSKY AND THE HERMENEUTICS OF SUSPICION<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>

Author(s): Tengelyi László<br>
Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort <br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and other social sciences are influenced by constructivism when they connect the transformation of static and traditional societies into modern and dynamic ones predominantly with the division of labour (Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Pareto, American pragmatic sociology etc.) The social constructivism of Schutz, Berger, Luckmann and Goffman directed the focus of sociology to the intentional structuring of everyday social reality (taken for granted) by mutual communication and individual activities. Our survey of social constructivism continues with the theories of semiotic construction of reality: Garfinkel's studies of indexical expressions, Habermas' theory of argumentative rationality and Ricoeur's hermeneutics. The author finally offers his own theory on the social construction of reality by parallel institutionalisation and narrativization. The central puzzle of this theory is how to cope with extreme situations, crisis and transitions.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not envision so explicit an invitation (or even exhortation) to action. Rather he insists on understanding how poetic or fictional texts refer to the world outside of language. In a significant move, Ricoeur rejects the false choice between conceiving of a text as either a transparent window into conscious authorial intention or as a closed, self-referential world. His approach instead treats authorship as one textual influence among many. Ricoeur says that his formulation of refiguration “is part of a hermeneutics that aims less at restoring the author's intention behind the text than at making explicit the movement by which the text unfolds, as it were, a world in front of itself” (1984, 1:81). Here Ricoeur directly engages the poststructuralist critique of authorial intention and textual reference. Yet he offers an insightful and sensible alternative to the idea that texts should be understood primarily as effects of language.
         
               Like Ricoeur, I see authorial/creative intention as an important aspect of reading texts of public memory that is nonetheless only part of the broader context of textual production and address. The intentions of creators leave indelible marks on the texts and thus on the public memories they disseminate. But many other factors affect the nature of a text, and Ricoeur's approach emphasizes that reality.12<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, Kant's corpus is essentially a philosophy of limits.
         
               In the Kantian universe, apart from limitations on action, there are also dimensions of reality beyond the epistemological reach of the species. Specifically, human knowing is limited to objects conditioned by time and space. We mortals, for example, cannot know a hypothesized God, his purposes and methods—or any other postulated transcendental entity—because the efficacy of speculative reason ends where the border of the unconditioned begins. Stated technically, humans can know phenomena, things that are perceived or interpreted, but not things as they are in themselves independent of the mind (noumena). This means that any notion of totalization, of obtaining absolute knowledge, in the manner articulated by, say, Hegel, is chimerical. For Kant, then, neither the theoretical nor the empirical sphere furnishes adequate grounds to support the contention that a reconciliation of freedom and nature is possible. Now, if nothing in our knowledge or experience indicates that freedom can be rehabilitated, a potentially devastating dilemma arises for Kant: how can he save his ethics, which presupposes that ought implies can, if the will is inexorably impotent in the face of omnipresent evil? How can we do what we must if we are denied autonomy? If we cannot emancipate the will, a major plank in Kant's philosophical edifice will collapse under the weight of an unresolvable aporia. Kant, of course, is well aware of the impasse and in his29
            Critique of Judgmentposits the transformative power of art as the means of mediating between actuality and freedom. Unfortunately, Kant never fully develops the idea of how symbolic expression, a product of the creative imagination, can genuinely resuscitate the vulnerable will, so the question he himself believes religion poses—what may I hope?—remains incompletely answered. However, this lacuna is all the inspiration Ricoeur needs to bui<br>
