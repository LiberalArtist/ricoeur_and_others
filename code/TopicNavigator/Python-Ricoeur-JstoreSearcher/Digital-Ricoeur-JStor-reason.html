  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Book Title: The Heart Has Its Reasons-Towards a Theological Anthropology of the Heart<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tóth Beáta<br>
  Abstract: This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.<br>

  Abstract: In his book,
                  Oneself as Another,Paul Ricoeur explains that identity is partly bound up in identification with significant others, which is the reason why, especially in autobiographies, writing the self implies writing the other. This idea resounds with one of the key insights in autobiography theory in the 1990s, namely that identity—for both men and women—is essentially relational, formed and defined in relation to others. As Laura Marcus points out, “Recounting one’s own life almost inevitably entails writing the life of an other or others; writing the life of another must surely entail the biographer’s identifications with<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Jones Bonna<br>
Abstract: This openness to interpretation is what recontextualizes each reading in the series of readings, which is another reason why Ricoeur speaks of the text as having only semiautonomy. Great texts, such as those of Shakespeare, are open to recontextualization through new audiences and new reading encounters. The closure that is achieved in such texts is only temporary. Ricoeur argues that it is at the level of the text that we can best understand human objectification in the form of structural explanation and the hermeneutic understanding that is the counterpart of such explanation [
         42].<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Author(s): Kemp Peter<br>
Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutics, moreover, challenges the central role that Husserl ascribes to intuition, especially in his early works. The call to return to the things themselves is heeded by a return to what is given in intuition. But, as Ricoeur puts it, “the Husserlian demand for the return to intuition is countered by the necessity for all understanding to be mediated by an interpretation.”
         
               In support of this claim, Ricoeur draws inspiration from Heidegger's conception of the as-structure of being, which maintains that being is always revealed in a partial manner, as this or as that.13
            
               This as-structure suggests that nothing is ever directly or fully given, and for this reason, what is given always calls for a process of interpretation enabling it to be seen as this or that. If it is the case that all givenness is perspectival and partial, Ricoeur contends that phenomenology “cannot constitute itself without a14
            hermeneutical presupposition. The hermeneutical condition of phenomenology is linked to the role ofAuslegungin the fulfillment of its philosophical project.”

Abstract: Two spaces of interface stand out specifically: an interest in interpretation and a commitment to understanding human action. Generally speaking, Ricoeur's foundations in philosophical hermeneutics resonate with inquiries in rhetoric, and his deft balance of analytic and Continental approaches to philosophy provides a sensible perspective on the processes of textual interpretation. Ricoeur's work attends to concerns that might be described by some rhetorical scholars as “traditional” while also taking seriously the challenges that poststructural critiques pose to such concerns (see Ihde 2007, xvi, and Ricoeur
         1977, 257–313). For this reason, Ricoeur's scholarship provides a sensible point of mediation between views on language and human agency that can tend toward the extremes.<br>

Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>
