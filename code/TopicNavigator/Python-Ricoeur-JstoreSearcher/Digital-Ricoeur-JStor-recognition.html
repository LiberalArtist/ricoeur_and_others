  Book Title: Recognizing the Gift-Toward a Renewed Theology of Nature and Grace<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortres<br>
  Author(s): Rober Daniel A.<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the Gift puts twentieth-century Catholic theological conversations on nature and grace, particularly those of Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner, into dialogue with Continental philosophy, notably the thought of Jean-Luc Marion and Paul Ricoeur. It argues that a renewed theology of nature and grace must build on the accomplishments of the recent past while acknowledging that an engagement with the political is unavoidable for theology. Ultimately, the aim is to revive and broaden discussion of nature and grace by drawing together the insights of contemporary theologians and Continental philosophers. Too often these areas of inquiry remain quite separate, in part due to differing priorities. This work tries to open that conversation, in part by critically pointing out, in dialogue with Ricoeur, the need in Marion’s work for an acknowledgment of recognition, reciprocity, and the political. It thus argues for a theology of nature and grace in terms of recognition of the gift, drawing out the reciprocal and political nature of gift and givenness in opposition to those, including Marion, who would seek to avoid politics and reciprocity as a proper avenue of inquiry for theology.<br>

  A Resource for the Theology of Nature and Grace? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19qgfxw">Recognizing the Gift</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous two chapters have raised the question of gift and recognition as a resource for the theology of nature and grace. Jean-Luc Marion’s careful analysis of the gift and the saturated phenomenon offers valuable insights while also making overtures to theology, but it falls short on some key points, particularly its denial of reciprocity and underdeveloped notion of recognition. Paul Ricoeur’s work, as I have explained, offers correctives to Marion’s by pairing a less-developed notion of gift with a stronger account of recognition and reciprocity. In the conclusion of the last chapter, I began to draw out how these<br>

  Abstract: Until recently the work of French philosopher and musician Vladimir Jankélévitch (1903–1985) has been scarcely acknowledged in the English-speaking world. Over the last few years, some of his texts have appeared in English translation, in part because of the growing recognition of the importance of his moral philosophy for figures such as Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida.¹ It is little known, for example, that Emmanuel Levinas acknowledged Jankélévitch as a source of the notion of the “absolutely” or “wholly other” (

The focus here will be on the nature of human capability itself, as fulfilled within a liturgical context; having reflected in previous chapters on the polyphony of liturgical language and symbolism, we must now consider the kind of self that may respond to such “music.” The subsequent chapters will afford the opportunity to examine the way in which the capable subject experiences the configuration of memory through the work of liturgy.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur importantly contends that the logic of equivalence and the logic of superabundance, the reciprocated and the pure gift, are not ultimately opposed. He articulates this in “Love and Justice” and
            The Course of Recognition. Contrast this with John Milbank who, while he rightly wishes to purify the agonism of Mauss’s gift without abandoning exchange or reciprocity, objects to any moment of gift exchange that has a unilateral moment. See John Milbank, “Can the Gift Be Given? Prolegomena to a Future Trinitarian Metaphysic,”Modern Theology11 (1995): 139–61.<br>

Author(s): Kämpf Heike<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies. As soon, however, as the gift loses this special capacity to express recognition, the mutual recognition of donor and recipient will be lost.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the ethical responsibilities of relating and responding to subjects of oppression in the context of collaborative life writing. One well-established ethical response to oppression is the practice of recognition. Drawing on the phenomenological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Paul Ricoeur, as well as the related work of Kelly Oliver, I raise some of the limitations of recognition, and delineate the ethical alternative of witnessing, bringing both to bear on my collaborative work with Holocaust survivor Rhodea Shandler.<br>

Abstract: La problématique de la reconnaissance que Ricoeur développe dans son ultime ouvrage n'est pas seulement un nouveau chantier philosophique qu'il ouvre à ses lecteurs. Une lecture rétrospective de son oeuvre découvre que cette thématique est le dernier fruit de l'herméneutique des symboles développée dans les années 60 et de l'herméneutique du soi exposée dans Soi-même comme un autre. Une interprétation systématique des trois études du Parcours de la reconnaissance montre quel sens la formule : « Je me suis reconnu philosophe » revêtirait dans la bouche de Ricœur. The topic of recognition that Ricoeur develops in his final work does not only open a whole new field of inquiry for his readers. A retrospective reading of his work discovers that this theme is the last fruit of the hermeneutics of symbols developped during the 1960s and of the hermeneutics of the self examined in Oneself as Another. A systemic interpretation of the three studies included in Parcours de la reconnaissance shows the meaning that the phrase « I recognized myself as a philosopher » would take on according to Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Abstract: The movement from
            thentonow, so far as ethics and philosophy of religion are concerned, can be largely told in relation to five proper names: Ricoeur, Levinas, Kierkegaard, Derrida, and Marion. Paul Ricoeur was already part ofthen, but as he kept writing, so broadly and so deeply, he became more and more an inescapable part of thenow. The problem is that he did this in so many different ways that he could easily take up all my time and space and then some. Not just in such collections asThinking BiblicallyandFiguring the Sacredbut whenever he wrote about virtually anything, be it time and narrative, memory, metaphor, interpretation, translation, ideology, evil, justice, the self (as other), recognition, or whatever, he provoked our thought about either ethics or religion or both. So, with gratitude and apologies, I'll leave him as the one who has shaped ournow, so far as ethics and religion are concerned, in more different but deep ways than anyone else. He is in any case more important for the first revolution than for the second.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>
