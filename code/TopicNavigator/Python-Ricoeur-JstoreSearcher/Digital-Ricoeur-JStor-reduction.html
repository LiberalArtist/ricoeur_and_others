Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Article Title: The Identity of the Literal Sense: Midrash in the Work of Hans Frei<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: If we return to Ricoeur for a moment, Frei’s emphasis on how the “Christlike pattern” of the literal sense attends to contingency and eventuality may answer some of Ricoeur’s concerns regarding the privilege of narrative in Christian interpretation. For, as Ricoeur describes, the “Christian pattern” of narrative tends to highlight continuity and function as a form of consolation that freezes the polyphony of discourse: “The question, then, is whether the so‐called biblical narrative is not a culturally motivated reduction of the rich interplay of temporal qualities that are displayed by the different literary genres encompassed in the canonical scriptures.”
         28In light of the above comments, and given the further discussions of Midrash that follow below, then one can see that Frei envisages the literal sense of narrative as providing an alternative to the “Christian pattern” that troubles Ricoeur. At its best—perhaps, when practiced with real obedience—the literal sense envisages a scriptural world that is attentive to the temporality and historicity of singularity.<br>

Article Title: Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Article Title: THE CRISIS OF NARRATIVE IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24439058<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis of narrative in contemporary culture. It begins by examining the challenge represented by the mass media for the continuing art of storytelling. Taking up Walter Benjamin's warning that we are moving from an age of narrative experience to an age of instant information, it analyses the implications of the post-modern 'cult of simulation' for education, historiography and ethics. The paper concludes by advocating a critical hermeneutic approach as the most apt response to this contemporary dilemma. Only by means of such hermeneutic retrieval, inspired by the work of Ricoeur and Gadamer, can we avoid the current reduction of temporal experience to a 'depthless present' without past or future, thereby reaffirming the crucial narrative dimensions of historical memory and hope.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: In
      Phenomenology “Wide Open,”Janicaud gets his starting point by noting two competing tendencies within Husserlian phenomenology: first, there is Husserl's “metaphysical” effort to establish phenomenology as a first philosophy; second, there are his patient descriptions leading to the development of various regional ontologies. The former tendency—or what might be called a maximal phenomenology—is the one that inspires the proponents of the theological turn who regard phenomenology as the only conceivable path for metaphysics today. Janicaud, by contrast, develops his notion of a minimal phenomenology in line with the other tendency in Husserl's work. This marks a twofold shift of approach. Terminologically, it means eschewing the pretenses to reach the absolute, to be scientific, and to become a foundation of the new metaphysics. A minimal phenomenology speaks more modestly in terms of testing hypotheses within a larger project, seeking out the morphology of a set of appearances, or dealing with something in its uniqueness. Methodologically, minimal phenomenology follows the lead of Merleau-Ponty and goes directly to the phenomena without a detour through the phenomenological reduction, which is part and parcel of phenomenology's foundational impulses.<br>
