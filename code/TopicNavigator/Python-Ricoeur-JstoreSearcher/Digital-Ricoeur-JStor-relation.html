  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will examine how Marcel refines his reflective method, especially the dialectical relation between primary reflection and secondary reflection, over the course of his career. To perform this task, I will assess how Gabriel Marcel refines his reflective method, especially the dialectical relation between primary reflection and secondary reflection, over the course of his career. First, I trace briefly how he refines his reflective method from his January 21, 1933, address to the Philosophical Society of Marseilles, “Concrete Approaches to Investigating the Ontological Mystery,” to his 1968 conversations with Paul Ricoeur published in

  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: One of the abiding features of Paul Ricoeur’s long and productive career has been his “double allegiance” to philosophical and religious thought. Ricoeur tells us that he has “always moved back and forth between . . . a Biblical pole and a rational and critical pole, a duality that, finally, has lasted through my entire life . . . a continuous negotiation with a wellestablished bi-polarity . . . [a] sort of controlled schizophrenia . . . a double allegiance to which, ultimately I remained faithful.”¹ This duality is paramount for Ricoeur and constitutes a relation of mutual distance and<br>

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Abstract: In his book,
                  Oneself as Another,Paul Ricoeur explains that identity is partly bound up in identification with significant others, which is the reason why, especially in autobiographies, writing the self implies writing the other. This idea resounds with one of the key insights in autobiography theory in the 1990s, namely that identity—for both men and women—is essentially relational, formed and defined in relation to others. As Laura Marcus points out, “Recounting one’s own life almost inevitably entails writing the life of an other or others; writing the life of another must surely entail the biographer’s identifications with<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Article Title: Book Review<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2002.112.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2002<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Suppose we begin with the subject who seeks personal fulfillment and meaningful human associations within just institutions. For Ricoeur, this subject is defined by its capacities for language, action, narrative identity, and for ethical and moral evaluation. As a subject I am that who speaks, acts, narrates my life, and evaluates objects and actions as good in ethical evaluation or obligatory in moral evaluation. These capacities all possess a triadic structure: I can designate myself as an “I” or the subject who is speaking only within a structure that includes a “you” to whom I speak and a he/she/it about whom or which we speak. Ricoeur claims that this last relationship represents the institution of language “inasmuch as it encompasses all the speakers of one natural language who know themselves and who are bound together by the recognition of the common rules that distinguish one language from another” (p. 6). Consequently, Ricoeur criticizes social contract liberalism because it presupposes a subject who possesses natural rights prior to the contractual relation. For Ricoeur, the subject of rights emerges only through the political mediation that provides the institutional conditions under which mere capacities can be actualized as accomplishments.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 522216<br>
Date: 10 2008<br>
Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: In the first case, the loss of a friend, Augustine’s grief teaches him that his love is excessive, an expression of inordinate self‐love. See Augustine,
            Confessions, trans. with an introduction by P. S. Pine‐Coffin (New York: Penguin, 1983), bk. 4. Augustine worries about the same problem after the death of his mother, which launches the principal confession ofConfessions, in bk. 9, chap. 12. Mourning is clearly a response to death for Augustine and has deep connections to his awareness of human finitude and the power of time more generally. Mourning, then, has moral and ontological aspects. In that respect, we must read Augustine’s narrative account of his grief in relation to his theological account of humanity’s being‐in‐time inConfessions, bk. 11. As an act of memory, mourning for Augustine would be an act of what Ricoeur calls “being‐in‐the‐face‐of‐death, against‐death.” See Ricoeur,Memory, History, Forgetting, 369; Lloyd, “Augustine and the ‘Problem' of Time.”<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of<br>

Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes<br>

Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con<br>

Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con <br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Abstract: Lately, the concept of experience, which postmodernist theoreticians declared dead, has seen renaissance. The immediacy of experience seems to offer the possibility of reaching beyond linguistic discourses. In their attempt to overcome the "linguistic turn," scholars such as Ankersmit, Gumbrecht, and Runia pit experience against narrative. This paper takes up the recent interest in experience, but argues against the opposition to narrative into which experience tends to be cast. The relation between experience and narrative is more complex than is widely assumed. Besides representing and giving shape to experience, narratives are received in the form of a (reception) experience. Through their temporal structure, narratives are crucial to letting us re-experience the past as well as to representing the experiences of historical agents. This potential of narrative is nicely illustrated by Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in which "side-shadowing" devices restore history's experientiality. Through "side-shadowing," narrative can challenge the tendency toward teleologies inherent in merely retrospective histories and can re-create the openness intrinsic to the past when it still was a present. However, the "side-shadowing" devices used by Thucydides are fictional. To conceptualize the price and gain of "side-shadowing" in historiography, the paper advances the concept of a "narrative reference" (a concept analogous to Ricoeur's "metaphorical reference"). Introspection, speeches, and other "side-shadowing" devices sacrifice truth in a positivist sense, but permit a second-level reference, namely to history's experientiality. In a final step, the paper turns toward modern historians—most of whom are reluctant to use the means of fiction—to briefly survey their attempts at restoring the openness of the past.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: La présente étude se consacre à un examen du concept de la mémoire collective en s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation que Paul Ricœur propose de ce concept dans son ouvrage La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. L'auteur présente une lecture critique de l'interprétation de la mémoire collective chez Ricœur là ou Ricœur tente de comprendre ce phénomène par analogie avec la mémoire personnelle et risque, selon cette lecture, d'occulter les dimensions de la mémoire collective qui échappent à un tel rapport analogique. L'auteur tente alors de dépasser le cadre de cette analogie par une analyse des sources symboliques et métapersonnelles de la mémoire collective. This study examines the concept of collective memory through an investigation of Paul Ricœur's interpretation of this concept in his work, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. In presenting a critical reading of the analogy Ricoeur establishes between collective and personal memory, the author argues that this analogy risks excluding those dimensions of collective memory which cannot be comprehended through such an analogy. The attempt is then made to surmount this difficulty through an analysis of collective memory in relation to its symbolic and metapersonal sources.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Woolf's prose is not her famous penchant for simile, but her constant use of the less ostentatious, though more radical, verb metaphor. Combining these figures in strings, in which the verbs are consistent but the implied nouns contradictory, Woolf deliberately unsettles the reader, forcing him or her to consider not only the tenuous relations between the word and the world, but the contingent nature of phenomenal reality itself. Thus the view of life as something at once "very shifting" and "very solid" (expressed in the diaries and dramatized in the novels), pervades the essays, captured in the paradoxical relation "it is and is not" that Paul Ricoeur claims lies at the heart of metaphor. A close study of a paradigmatic essay, "On Not Knowing Greek," and of manuscript drafts in New York and Sussex reveals that this tension between shifting and solid extends to the syntax, which manages to be both extravagant and firmly anchored, and to the developing structure of the essay as a whole, which traces a movement of mind (a strategy James Farrell defines as specifically "feminine"), remaining defiantly heuristic and resisting the inherent closure of the formal essay. Thus, like her novels, Woolf s reviews and essays engage us in the process of perception even while inviting us to explore critically the operations of language in that perception.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Article Title:  أسطورة الخلق في شرق أفريقيا / The Myth of Creation in East Africa <br>
Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Abstract: In
         Time and Narrative, Ricoeur aligns the first stage of the hermeneutic circle, mimesis1, with the function of “prefiguration.” This concept describes the way in which narratives are “emplotted” according to “a preunderstanding of the world of action” (1984, 1:54). Ricoeur explains that preunderstanding has three primary features that affect the composition of a plot: meaningful structures, symbolic resources, and temporal character. The “meaningful structures” to which he refers can also be understood as a “conceptual network” of actions, people, events, stories, and the like. Just as words in a sentence constitute the level of semantic composition, the building blocks of activity in a narrative constitute a “semantics of action.” When writing of mimesis1, Ricoeur concentrates on the resources available within the context in which the text was produced rather than on describing how texts exhibit a semantics of action. It is in this cultural context that he locates the latent possibilities for emplotting action in a narrative. The “symbolic resources” are the ingredients of emplotment in a narrative, much as nouns, verbs, and objects are the ingredients of a sentence. Which types of resources are publicly available for representing human action? What are the various formulations for embedding human action in the unfolding of time? That is, what is the “temporal character” of narratives? How are human beings within a given cultural and historical context predisposed to understand the relation of human beings and human activities to time? How is time itself conceived in the society? Each of these elements—structures, symbols, and temporality—contributes to the prefiguration of the field of understanding wherein a narrative is emplotted (1984, 1:54–64).<br>

Abstract: For example, Shaw could agree with Schopenhauer that the world is fundamentally Will and simultaneously reject his metaphysics of unmitigated pessimism. He could concur with Nietzsche that the Judeo-Christian God is a deceased phantom and that institutionalized religion is a repressive force but still devoutly believe in a limited and liberating divine-like creative Life Force that suffuses the cosmos and drives evolution. He could also vehemently reject Darwin in favor of Lamarck on the grounds that the former banished not only mind but hope from the universe, leaving everything to fickle chance, whereas the latter accommodated will, purpose, and effort in mapping the descent of species. And he could agree with Marx that capitalism is a pestilence and deny both the determinism inherent in dialectical materialism as well as the implication that capitalists per se are wicked. In another register, he could denounce vaccines and vivisectionists and still lobby for something like a National Health Service, staffed by professionals dedicated to keeping the nation healthy through certified medical practices, in contradistinction to the unscrupulous charlatans of the day, who exploited human misery by peddling snake oil cures. Similarly, he could chide scientists for mistaking the relation of cause and effect but praise Einstein for his discovery of the curvilinear universe. He could likewise doubt the veracity of the Bible as literal truth but cherish the redemptive dimensions of its symbols, metaphors, and parables. In this connection, he could eschew the idea that Jesus died sacrificially on the cross to expiate our sins vicariously, only to rise from the dead three days later, and at the same affirm that the Nazarene embodied, in his teachings and actions, the best roadmap we have to earthly salvation. And perhaps most important of all, he could see the ubiquity of evil yet nevertheless maintain that it was a contingent rather than a necessary fact of life—more a produ<br>
