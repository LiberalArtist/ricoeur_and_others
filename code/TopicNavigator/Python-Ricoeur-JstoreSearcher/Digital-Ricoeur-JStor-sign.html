  Reflections on the Work of Paul Ricoeur from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: By Paul Ricoeur’s own account, the dynamic of detour and return is the central motif of his philosophy. As he said to Charles Reagan: “Detour/return is the rhythm of my philosophical respiration.”¹ The pattern is so pervasive that it shaped the trajectory of his entire career: a philosophy of the will that

  Migration: Explanation, Analysis, and Directions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkchb">Migrating Texts and Traditions</a><br>
  Author(s) Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: Among the European philosophical traditions that have a presence in East Asia, continental philosophy and especially hermeneutics have a particularly strong following. Beginning in the mid-1980s, for example, a number of major Western texts—by Walter Benjamin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur and Richard Rorty—became available in Chinese translation, and this interest shows no sign of abating.² In the present essay, I want to look at how those texts that focus on hermeneutics have been introduced, and arguably have migrated, into the East Asian milieu (specifically that of Taiwan) and ask how it is that the hermeneutical method has come<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Still, the book has significant shortcomings. First, it suffers from a bad case of sprawl. Reynolds attempts to engage the following thinkers at some length: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Gottfried Herder, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean‐Francois Lyotard, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Richard Rorty, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Charles Taylor, Paul Tillich, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Dozens more receive passing mention. This, however, is nothing compared to the book’s many arguments. Reynolds forwards vast theses not only in philosophical theology and the theory of religion but also in hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics. For good measure, we also get a typology of world religions (162) and an interpretation of the Enlightenment (22–41). Sheer breadth, of course, is not necessarily a weakness. It can be an impressive sign of intellectual power and agility. In this case, however, it comes at the expense of nuance. Consequently,
      The Broken Wholesometimes reads more like a term paper for a graduate survey course than a focused monograph.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],
p. 344).

Author(s): Bourgeois Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: My aim in this memorial paper is to recall two essential Ricoeurean themes that underlie his entire philosophical orientation and that respond well to specific challenges today from postmodern deconstruction. At question is whether Ricoeur's account of sign in language and the living present in time can adequately respond to and meet the recent challenge from postmodern deconstruction, which radically challenges the very root of his phenomenological and hermeneutic orientation: the priority of the semantic in language and the priority of the living present. Although Ricoeur and Derrida will be seen to address the same problems of decentering consciousness, their accounts, although agreeing on importnat issues, quickly become mutually exclusive and deconstruction becomes a challenge to Ricoeurean hermeneutics. I will turn first to the postmodern deconstruction of Jacques Derrida before turning to Ricoeur's response with a more viable view of language, sense, and lived time.<br>
