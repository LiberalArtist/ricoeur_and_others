  Abstract: In this chapter I will examine how Marcel refines his reflective method, especially the dialectical relation between primary reflection and secondary reflection, over the course of his career. To perform this task, I will assess how Gabriel Marcel refines his reflective method, especially the dialectical relation between primary reflection and secondary reflection, over the course of his career. First, I trace briefly how he refines his reflective method from his January 21, 1933, address to the Philosophical Society of Marseilles, “Concrete Approaches to Investigating the Ontological Mystery,” to his 1968 conversations with Paul Ricoeur published in
                  Tragic Wisdom and Beyond.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Bender Thomas<br>
Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Publisher: American Historical Association<br>
Issue: 587015<br>
Date: April 2003<br>
Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Article Title: Education as Text: The Varieties of Educational Hiddenness<br>
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Issue: i23019993<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Rothchild Jonathan<br>
Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: O presente texto surge do desejo de pensar a relação entre direito e ética. O diálogo entre estas duas áreas, sentido como um desafio premente para os dias de hoje, coloca em cena a relação da própria ciência jurídica com a sociedade onde se insere. A teoria da argumentação apresentada por autores como Jürgen Habermas, Chaïm Perelman e Paul Ricoeur permite iluminar de modo renovado esta temática clássica, superando a actual dificuldade em estabelecer uma ligação entre os domínios da ética e do direito. A reflexão parte de um primeiro enquadramento teórico, analisando o confronto histórico entre ética e direito e apontando caminhos de conciliação para a actualidade. Em seguida, apresentam-se algumas concretizações do papel da ética na prática jurídica, pelo seu contributo para a elaboração e aplicação do direito. Por último, o texto aborda possíveis contribuições do direito para a uma construção ética. This paper aims to discuss the relationship between law and ethics. The dialogue between both areas is a pressing and current challenge, which puts into play the relationship of legal science with the society. The theory of argumentation presented by authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Chaim Perelman and Paul Ricoeur, illuminates in a new way this classic issue, overcoming the present difficulties in establishing a link between the fields of ethics and law. The reflection starts with a theoretical framework, which analyzes the historical clash between the two approaches and points out a possible path of reconciliation. Then, it presents some embodiments of the role of ethics in legal practice, for its contribution to the elaboration and application of law. Finally, it discusses some possible contributions of law for the moral discourse.<br>

Article Title: The contours of memory in post-conflict societies: enacting public remembrance of the bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Yes, regrettably, the species is fallen and the will is impaired. Nevertheless, these deficiencies are remediable for Shaw and Ricoeur. The two place unwavering faith in the ineradicable goodness of creation and lodge unflagging hope in the inextirpable capacity of humans to repair the damage they have done to themselves and the planet that houses them. Things can be different. Lives need not be beggared. Tomorrow can be better than today. This is the inspiriting wager Shaw and Ricoeur make, with eyes fully open to the countless maladies that mar existence. Through the maelstroms that swirled around them, they stayed the course, undaunted: they remained faithful, hopeful, spiritual, creative, and humane; they lived long, active, and productive lives of notable achievement; they made uplifting the least advantaged the locus of their ameliorative efforts; they sought justice, equality, and reconciliation for everyone; and the world is a much better place because of them. By such benchmarks, Shaw and Ricoeur epitomize wellness. For these kindred spirits, ever the intrepid circumnavigators of the entropic regions, one touch of the divine that permeates the universe makes us all brothers and sisters under the skin. Accordingly, as harried members of a single global family under siege, it follows in their thinking that we are responsible for one another's welfare, and that we cannot save our individual selves apart from saving humankind at large. Hence, we cannot injure someone unjustly, or allow another to suffer unnecessarily, without diminishing ourselves. In the inclusive society they envision, our shared humanity elicits shared responses to life's exigencies wherever they occur.<br>
