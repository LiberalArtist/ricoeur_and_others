  Abstract: In mainstream theories of world politics, the workings of political power are usually seen as a historical constant. They share the view expressed so clearly by Paul Ricoeur that “power does not have much of a history.”¹ At the same time, political power is overwhelmingly associated with “the modern state,” to which all states are supposed to correspond, but which is usually a version of France, England, or the United States regarded as a unitary actor equivalent to an individual person. Political power is envisioned in terms of units of territorial sovereignty (at least for the so-called Great Powers) that<br>

  Abstract: Nell’accingerci ad esaminare il tema dei rapporti tra l’interpretazione dei testi e la comprensione dell’agire - tema di fondamentale importanza per la riflessione ermeneutica odierna, come attestano le ricerche che negli ultimi vent’anni sono state ad esso dedicate¹ - sarà opportuno iniziare con il chiedersi che cosa possa esservi di comune tra l’insieme di atti mediante i quali penetriamo il significato dei prodotti dell’attività linguistica che siamo soliti individuare come “testi” ed i processi che ci consentono di cogliere il senso del comportamento di quanti, fuggevol­mente o in maniera costante, entrano nel nostro orizzonte di vita e fini­scono con l’influenzare<br>

  Abstract: ‘A period of experimentation of all types’ – with these terms the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur once described the interwar years through which he had lived as a young man.¹ Tomás Masaryk, just installed as first president of the new Czechoslovak state, thought post-1918 Europe a ‘laboratory built over the great graveyard of the World War’.² Europeans were partly forced to experiment because both tradition and dynastic legitimacy had ceased to provide principles for public order, but new ones had hardly become entrenched. A liberal restoration proved impossible – there were too many new people in politics, too many new<br>

  Abstract: Having recalled the fact of an uncritical but constant claim that the Spirit
                  of Godis at work in us and in the world, I have highlighted the main difficulties to which this claim gives rise. This sequence is well known to believers: after a time of peaceful possession of the faith, they become aware of challenges to it. If not doubt, at least an ongoing questioning—what St. Thomas called thecogitatio—is a part of the faith. It is the passport into what Paul Ricoeur calls the second naiveté,¹ which is more or less the state of a<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur turns to Walzer’s work, then, not to move from a Rawlsian liberalism to communitarianism but to look at another question: that of the divisibility of principles of justice within a particular state. Again Ricoeur emphasizes the importance of political community. He thinks Walzer errs in viewing the question of politics solely as a question of the just distribution of political power since, in doing so, he fails to examine the status of the political community within which distributions proceed. Ricoeur acknowledges the attention Walzer pays to questions of membership in a political community. Still, he thinks that what Walzer’s work illuminates is “the uncomfortable situation of an entity called upon to behave at the same time as the whole and as the part, as the container and the contained, as inclusive agency and an included region” (p. 93). Rather than moving to a more communitarian view, then, Ricoeur accepts a modified version of Rawlsian liberalism: Rawls successfully constructs a single set of principles of justice, and we need only recognize that the grounds for this selection lie in our preexisting conception of the good rooted in our aspirations for meaningful lives and friendships within just institutions.<br>

Abstract: Using the analogy of reader and text (wherein the latter is very broadly defined as an objectification or product of action), Ricoeur argues that human experiences, grounded in the world of action, take on the nature of prenarratives [
            14]. These prenarratives are in a state of prefiguration, and their articulation becomes the narration of an experience, which he calls configuration. Once narrated, the possibility exists for refiguration, or reauthoring. In terms of relationship, these are the three moments in the mimetic operations that make up the process of emplotment. They enable us to be conducted “from one side of the text to the other” [14, p. 53] through the action of reading (where reading is a mediator in a process). Ricoeur argues that configuration and refiguration have a faculty of mediation enabling a work to “lift … itself above the opaque depths of living, acting, and suffering, to be given by an author to readers who receive it and thereby change their acting” [14, p. 53]. Because it is the reader who takes up the unity of the traversal from prefiguration (mimesis1) to refiguration (mimesis3) by way of configuration (mimesis2), this being done by way of reading [14], and because Ricoeur argues that narrative is central to human endeavors to make sense of the world, these would seem to be important operations for LIS to consider in theoretical terms.<br>

Abstract: As developed in
         Interpretation Theoryand elsewhere, Ricoeur’s position is best known for his reworking of the “reference” of the text. Where many philosophers and theologians have tended to treat reference as ostensive, designating a state of affairs or event “outside” or prior to the text, Ricoeur calls us to think of reference as a world of possibility that opens through the text. The text—especially biblical scripture—opens a distinctive, unique world in which a range of possibilities for reflection and practice emerge; as he writes, the goal of interpretation “is achieved insofar as the interpretation actualizes the meaning of the text for the present reader.”12Ricoeur and Frei therefore agree that biblical reference need not be conceived ostensively. However, from Frei’s standpoint, Ricoeur’s emphasis on the text opening a world of understanding for the reader moves too quickly toward the subjective appropriation of reference, occluding the possibility of the biblical narrative’s self‐referentiality.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur,
            Memory, History, Forgetting, 68. Memory for Augustine is subject to the power of time, also understood as the power of death. Book 11 ofConfessions, exploring time as both a condition for and subject of memory, underscores finite humanity’s being‐toward‐death, the fact that time is “the impending state ofnot being.” SeeConfessions, bk. 11, par. 14. Ricoeur engages Heidegger on memory, historicity, and death inMemory, History, Forgetting, 357–69. See also n. 48.<br>

Abstract: A promise is a gift. Yet, it is a gift that warps the ordinary economy of giving. In this, any thinker who develops promise as a gift must attend to those who are interested in interrupting the ordinary gift economies that the anthropologists since Marcel Mauss have considered. Those gifts of equivalence, as Ricoeur called them, are economies that demand gifts to be returned. Because a promise consists of a given pledge and its ultimate fulfillment, it can be considered a doubled and extended gift. We can then generally state that a promise is a doubled gift. The donor promises, offering a token, down payment, or one’s word as the pledge of the promised gift. He or she next fulfills that promise by giving the promised gift. These two gifts are actually a single, doubled gift since they are related to one another by the act of promising and its initial symbolic delivery. Further, the promise is an extended gift since the promissory token and its final gift are separated in time; as Mauss indicated that gifts take and make time, a promise requires time.
         39The delay that obtains between the doubled token and gift extends the promise throughout time.<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text.

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Abstract: Until about 2005, it was hard to find any publication about literature during the communist era or any important work concerning this period. Since then, this astonishing silence has given way to the publication in Bulgaria of several novels and hybrid writings. In the meantime occured not only literary, but also political and social events which changed the issue: isn't the real problem in Bulgaria today no longer the institutional, generational, historiographical or literary silence, but the dilemna between the collective or individual responsability? To cope with these problems, the author takes into account both the works of Paul Ricoeur concerning the excess of memory and the excess of oblivion, the blocked memory, manipulated memory, abusively controlled or obligated memory, and two emblematic books concerning the communist past as seen in the State Security files: The Watched Man by Vesko Branev, and Surveillance and Conditioning: the literary prose of the State security by Žerminal Čivikov.

Abstract: Over the course of an academic career that involved many ups and downs, and many dislocations, SPEP has remained a constant, a place of refuge almost, where I could be recognized and accepted. Many friendships were formed and continued there, and after a time the possibility of seeing friends became a major reason for attending. It's strange that SPEP can seem like a fixed place to which one returns again and again, even though it is a movable feast held each year in a different place. In a certain sense arriving at SPEP each year is “getting back into place,” to plagiarize a well-known phenomenologist, even though we may be in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, or even (if we can find it) Penn State. Its heart and soul, of course, remains the exchange of ideas built around a common tradition: ideas, texts, philosophers. As important in the history of SPEP has been the appearance among us of some of the most important European philosophers of these last fifty years: We were too late to lure Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty to our shores, but we heard Gadamer, Arendt, Ricoeur, Habermas, Derrida, and many more.<br>

Abstract: I want to thank the organizers for allowing us to go back to those halcyon days of yore when we were young, the world was ours, and we, the carriers of the coals, were unintentionally about to bring critical theory to the United States. No doubt I played a minor role in that process, and looking back there was no singular event that led to my association with critical theory but, rather, a curious set of happenings that led to encounters, friendships, and a richness of life that I could not have fathomed when I made a simple trip to Germany in 1971. At the time I considered myself to be a thoroughgoing phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. I had written my first book on Paul Ricoeur and was hired to teach philosophy of religion, having had the good fortune of having been a student directly of Mircea Eliade and indirectly of Paul Ricoeur. No doubt I would still be teaching and writing about the philosophy of religion had it not been for the events of the day. America was “all shook up” with the opposition to the Vietnam War, the dilemma of the draft and the reaction to it on college campuses, Kent State, the invasion of Cambodia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and numerous other incidents. True, I had no particular qualifications to deal with those things; none of us did. But I was prone to try. I was equipped by sentiment if not by intellect.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: More than fifteen years have now passed since the publication of Dominique Janicaud's book
      Phenomenology “Wide Open”(Phénomenologie Eclatée)—the sequel to his controversial essay published inPhenomenology and the “Theological Turn.”
         
            There, as is widely known, Janicaud raised the question of whether the phenomenological enterprises of figures such as Emmanuel Levinas, Michel Henry, and Jean-Luc Marion were marked by a “theological turn” and, if so, whether such a turn was phenomenologically warranted. At this point, a voluminous literature over this debate exists, much of it defending the accused against those charges.1
         
            Perhaps as an indirect result of that focus, there has been relatively little discussion of Janicaud's later development of a “minimal phenomenology.”2
         
            To correct this state of affairs, the broad aim of this article is to redirect attention to Janicaud's minimal phenomenology and to show how it opens up new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.3<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, there is something more originary than evil is radical, and that something is the goodness of creation, as attested to by the Genesis narrative at 1:31: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.”
         
               While Ricoeur refrains from interpreting the Bible literally, he does discern in the symbolic story of creation a bedrock affirmation of the human capability for the good that precedes metaphysics and history and resides at the uppermost limit of rational thought. And this attestation is expressly the testimony he chooses to stake his life and work on, even if it cannot be verified empirically. Without such a leap into the Kantian unknowable, without this wager on the elemental goodness of being, faith, hope, and meaning itself, Ricoeur maintains, would eternally elude the grasp of humankind. Hence, Ricoeur can agree that evil is primordial and still believe that something—the good—is even more primordial. In other words, Ricoeur starts from the premise that we are predisposed toward the good but have a propensity toward evil. This means, in effect, that the will, although corruptible, is not fundamentally corrupt. It has to be seduced, led astray, before it falls victim to evil. Thus, for Ricoeur, we do not come into the world as damaged goods; rather, we damage our intrinsic goodness through the imprudent deeds we later enact. To put Ricoeur's point another way, that we have fallen implies that we fell from somewhere, and that somewhere is just our original, untainted state of goodness. Moreover, the fact that we have fallen also intimates to Ricoeur that with effort we might be able to get up, that with exertion we might become upright once again in the ontological sense of reclaiming something approaching our initial moral wholesomeness.37<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
