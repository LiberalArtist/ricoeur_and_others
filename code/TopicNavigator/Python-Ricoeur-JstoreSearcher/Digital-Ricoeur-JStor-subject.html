  Reflections on the Work of Paul Ricoeur from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: What do Paul Ricoeur and Amartya Sen have to do with one another? On the surface, not much. Ricoeur is a French hermeneutic philosopher and theologian; Sen is a Nobel Prize–winning Indian economist. Ricoeur researches such topics as subjectivity, imagination, and memory; Sen, poverty, development, and famine. But beneath their surface differences lies a fundamental similarity in their respective projects. Both take the notion of human capability as the central descriptive and normative feature of human existence. For Ricoeur, the capable human being (
                  l’homme capable) is the ultimate subject of philosophical analysis. For Sen, the right to capabilities forms<br>

  Author(s) MANOUSSAKIS JOHN PANTELEIMON<br>
  Abstract: Why “carnal” hermeneutics? Don’t we already talk enough about the body? After all, the body has, since the dawn of philosophy, been a topic of concern in one form or another. Plato talks about embodiment in the
                  RepublicandPhilebus. Aristotle takes up the subject inDe Anima, theNicomachean Ethics, De Partibus Animalium, and other works. Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, and others all write about the body; it has hardly been ignored. And don’t we already have enough flavors of hermeneutics? The latter half of the twentieth century was dominated by hermeneutics: Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur; the radicalization of these<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we trace the shape of liturgical subjectivity, employing the template provided by Ricoeur in his later works, especially
                  Oneself as AnotherandThe Course of Recognition. The focus here will be on the nature of human capability itself, as fulfilled within a liturgical context; having reflected in previous chapters on the polyphony of liturgical language and symbolism, we must now consider the kind of self that may respond to such “music.” The subsequent chapters will afford the opportunity to examine the way in which the capable subject experiences the configuration of memory through the work of liturgy.<br>

  Book Title: Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Tattam Helen<br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) stands outside the traditional canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. Where he is not simply forgotten or overlooked, he is dismissed as a ‘relentlessly unsystematic’ thinker, or, following Jean-Paul Sartre’s lead, labelled a ‘Christian existentialist’ — a label that avoids consideration of Marcel’s work on its own terms. How is one to appreciate Marcel’s contribution, especially when his oeuvre appears to be at odds with philosophical convention? Helen Tattam proposes a range of readings, as opposed to one single interpretation: a series of departures or explorations that bring Marcel’s work into contact with critical partners such as Henri Bergson, Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Lévinas and other insights into a host of twentieth-century philosophical shifts concerning time, the subject, the other, ethics, and religion.<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Genres as Interpretive Models from:

  Abstract: A theory of genre that will produce certainty about the real nature of literary works must await an answer to the question, “How is language possible?” Current theories that treat language “scientifically” in the narrow sense, as an object among other objects, must fail to deal adequately with the consciousness of meaning in the speaking and understanding subject. Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

  Author(s) PATTISON GEORGE<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary discussions about narrativity and selfhood commonly make reference to Alastair MacIntyre’s

Paul Ricoeur’s writings on the subject also figure prominently, and more recently, Marya Schechtman’sThe Constitution of Selveshas powerfully shaped the terms of the debate. Each of these philosophers defends a narrative model of personal identity as an alternative to physicalist or embodied theories, on the one hand, and psychological theories on the other. These latter approaches have tried to understand selfhood either by appeal to a self-identical<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: On the other hand, the Oedipus complex is likened to a basic unit of kinship subject to a set of transformative possibilities that lead, ideally, through the resolution of (incestuous) intrafamilial conflict, to wider extrafamilial relations through marriage and the social institutions and cultural expression that derive therefrom. The move, as Ricoeur (
      1969:121) would have it, is from destiny to history. Juillerat is more cautious, recognizing, as he does, the structural constraints of marital exchange.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Author(s): Jones Bonna<br>
Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur aims to make explicit the connections linking the modern notions of self with those of ancient world thinkers. This quite intriguing story begins with the chanting heroes of canonical Greek literature, who question their selves as they strive to explain the choices they have made. In so doing, says Ricoeur, these heroes recognize for themselves a sense of responsibility. The story then develops with the ethics of virtues developed by Aristotle, especially the virtue of wisdom. Following the correct rules of this virtue engages one to act as would a “wise man” under a given set of circumstances. Such a wise man directs his action under a second‐order rule about rational action—the rule of
      phronesis, of prudence. Through the exercise of his discretion, he reveals an important part of himself: his own point of view. This emergence of the moral self in action is the reason why Ricoeur wishes to trace back in Ancient Greece “the emergence of the point of view of the subject in the description of rational action” (87). To be sure, Ricoeur admits that this analysis is a retrospective reach. But it is no small feat to have been able to reach through many centuries of writing and thinking with such a clear and concise canvas.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Abstract: Susanne Mrozik’s
      Virtuous Bodiesrepresents a significant contribution to this current rethinking of religion and Buddhist studies. The author explicitly locates her approach within the interdisciplinary field of feminist studies while also effectively placing the subject of her analysis, Śāntideva’sCompendium of Training(Śikṣ āsamuccaya), in dialogue with the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault, Elizabeth Grosz, Paul Ricoeur, and Charles Hallisey. In one respect, this study can be seen as quite traditional: the author develops her argument through a close reading of an influential Buddhist text, paying careful attention to the subtleties of its Sanskrit vocabulary and attempting to situate it within the medieval North Indian monastic milieu within which it took shape. This textual analysis provides the basis on which Mrozik advances toward the first stated goal of her work, to correct “the widespread misconception in scholarship on Buddhism and Buddhist ethics that South Asian Buddhists (with the exception of practitioners of Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism) ascribed little value to bodies” (6). And Mrozik succeeds admirably in this regard, skillfully articulating how diverse and often seemingly contradictory perspectives on human embodiment come together in support of a religious ideal in which the “bodied being” (ātmabhāva) of bodhisattvas, interacting with the bodies of those whom they aim to liberate, plays a foundational role. Having first identified two dominant and contrasting somatic discourses in theCompendium of Training, one “physiomoral” and the other “ascetic,” Mrozik argues that the text presents a coherent ethical perspective, one in which “an ascetic discourse is in service of producing a range of virtuous bodied beings, valued for their physical as well as moral qualities” (116). As she notes, ascetic disciplines are grounded in an implicit assumption that embodiment matters greatly, even if these disciplines or “technologies of the self” ~<br>

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166).

Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: Anderson’s argument covers a lot of ground — from the works of Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne to the Vestiarian Controversy of the 1560s and the economic writings of Gerrard de Malynes — but she takes her first bearings from the twentieth-century theorists Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur. Derrida offers her an account of the persistence of the etymological trace, a theory of metaphor grounded in words. Ricoeur — from whom she also borrows a sense of metaphorical productivity as Hegelian sublation — describes the process of “lexicalization” through which a lively metaphor loses its polyvalence, governed by its role in particular sentences (and, by extension, in particular rhetorical and cultural contexts). The contest between surplus and lexicalization is this book’s subject, and Anderson teaches us how to measure the pressures in each direction. If she takes a side, it is Derrida’s, and her reasons are historical: the vernacular ferment of the period, its polylingualism, and the humanist grammarians’ emphasis on
      verbumover syntax (a subject central to her previous book,Words That Matter).<br>

Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i282749<br>
Date: 1 1, 1947<br>
Author(s): Sund Brendan<br>
Abstract: In 1957, Francis Bacon rapidly painted a series of five numbered paintings after van Gogh's "Self-Portrait on the Road to Tarason," to fill an exhibition. They are exceptional in his work, both as to subject and in the way they are painted. A painter who regularly took reproduced images as his sources, he chose in this unique case the self-portrait of another artist, and used -- also uniquely -- methods evidently akin to those of 'action painting'. So selfhood and the practice of painting come into unusual conjunction in these works. Paul Ricoeur's attempt, in "Oneself as Another," to overcome the perennial self--other opposition, and his account of a constitutionally unstable self, lacking a 'core', are suggestive for discussion of the relationship between viewer and painting, specifically with reference to portraiture. He presents an alternative to the antinomial theories of the self which have long dominated criticism of visual art, theories according to which visual images mirror, and so crucially help to construct, an ego enclosed against the other; such a model is presumed in Ernst van Alphen's "Francis Bacon and the Loss of Self." Admittedly, this series of paintings is itself bound to invoke what Ricoeur terms 'hyperbolic' concepts of selfhood: van, Gogh, through his biographers, became the type of artist-as-genius; Minelli's biopic "Lust for Life," which Bacon probably saw, came out in 1956, and in the same year Jackson Pollock, prototypical 'action painter' died in a way that contributed to a comparable mythology. Against that, it is important to consider what Bacon does, and to notice the kinds of action, or interaction, tended to us as viewers. In context, the link with cinema assumes a different importance. Also crucial is Bacon's process of variation. Unlike philosophy, as Ricoeur shows, art can engage in play, freely varying all terms without a view to conclusion -- art experiments with the self. Bacon takes selfhood apart, recombines its elements; he~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i371617<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Michael<br>
Abstract: The last thirty years have brought about a fundamental revision of historical epistemology. So intense a concentration on the nature of history as a form of inquiry has diminished attention given to the thing that history inquires into: the nature of the past itself. Too readily, that entire domain has turned into a place for dreams, as Hayden White put it: a lost world only available now through the imagination of the author and subject to aesthetic whim. The next thirty years will, I propose, be the period in which ontology returns to the center of historical theory. And nothing short of the reconceptualization of the past-indeed of time itself-must be its objective. It must achieve that objective, moreover, in establishing arguments that are congruent with what revisions of epistemology have taught us about the limits of historical knowledge and the inevitability of textual representation. This paper enters this field by discussing some of the issues involved in rethinking the place of time in historical constructions since Bergson. It demonstrates the confusions inherent in spatial reductions of temporality, which historians have done so much to entrench rather than eradicate, and argues that historians have yet to accommodate the fundamental conceptual shifts inaugurated by Heidegger. It then moves to propose a methodological doctrine to which I have given the name "chronism" and seeks to sketch the utility of such a doctrine for bringing one form of presence-that of authenticity-back into the domain of historical study. Doing so invites a number of conceptual and practical difficulties that the paper will address in its conclusions; these may disturb those who have closed their minds to anything beyond the present. Taking ontology seriously interferes both with structuralist assumptions about the nothingness of time and with some of the styles of historical representation that have become fashionable in the postmodern climate. There may be painful lessons to b~<br>

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse.

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: Inspired by Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis' claim in 1798 that physicians might learn forms of medical reasoning from les anciens rhéteurs, in this paper I explore intimate associations between medicine and rhetoric over the longue durée. Gravely susceptible to error, medical reasoning relies on signs and examples, both gleaned from experience and both the subject of rhetorical inquiry; like rhetoric, medicine reaches plausible conclusions from probable premises. Here, ranging from Hippocrates and Plato through Aristotle to early modern England, I argue that forms of inference developed and refined in the history of rhetoric offer ancient and early modern philosophers and physicians models and metaphors for their own forays into the probable.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de passer l'éthique de Ricœur au crible du rasoir d'Ogien, afin d'examiner si la pluralité des points de vue éthiques auxquels Ricœur ne cesse d'emprunter ne viserait pas à rendre compte des limites de toute éthique. Les points de convergence possibles entre les deux auteurs n'occultent nullement ceux de leur divergence : pour Ricœur, si le sujet moral n'est jamais fixe, ce n'est pas au prix d'une morale éclectique, mais parce que la sagesse n'est jamais accessible hors d'une faiblesse constitutive du sujet, sans cesse exposé aux effets pervers de ses propres choix. Le pluralisme éthique s'en trouve ainsi légitimé. The author goes over the ethical theory of Ricoeur with the fine-tooth comb of Ogien's minimalist approach, showing where they agree and where they diverge. Ricoeur's anthropology leads to the vision of a vulnerable subject, always exposed to the perverse effects of his own moral choices. Moral pluralism finds here its deepest justification.<br>

Abstract: ‘The subject that interprets himself while interpreting signs is no longer the cogito […] he is a being who discovers, by exegesis of his own life, that he is placed in being before he […] possesses himself. In this way hermeneutics would discover a manner of existing which would remain from start to finish a being-interpreted’,

Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>
