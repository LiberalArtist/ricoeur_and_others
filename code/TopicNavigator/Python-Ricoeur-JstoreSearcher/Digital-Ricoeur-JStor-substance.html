  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to work out two related claims regarding how to think about the fallen self, i.e., the self in sin. First, following on the relational ontology we sketched in the previous chapter, we need to think about sin relationally rather than in terms of substance and accidents. Second, in order to understand sin, we need recourse to figurative discourse. Taking Ricoeur as a point of departure, in the first section we will see why reflection on sin and evil requires a hermeneutics of figurative discourse. Sin and evil cannot be explained, but must be described.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Abstract: The substance of Ricoeur’s analysis is also problematic, specifically its attempt to incorporate “defilement” together with “sin” and “guilt” into a single linear scheme of changing conceptions of evil. Most recent studies endorse a more descriptive approach. See e.g., T. Frymer-Kensky, “Pollution, Purification and Purgation in Biblical Israel,” in

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con<br>

Article Title: Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h<br>

Abstract: 1. La problématique née en philosophie par le structuralisme, se cristallise dans une confrontation de la linguistique et de la philosophie du langage. Toutes les sciences humaines modernes s'inscrivent en effet dans le programme d'une sémiologie, science globale de la signification des signes et construite sur le modèle de la sémantique, discipline traitant la signification du signe linguistique. C'est à propos du récit, et en particulier du récit littéraire, que nous opposons l'analyse structurale, mouvement destructif qui réduit la plénitude du sens, à l'herméneutique, „interprétation comme récollection du sens” (P. Ricoeur). La critique littéraire connaissait déjà l'étude immanente du récit littéraire. C'est à l'intérieur de la critique immanente qu'il faut opposer un courant où l'œuvre est considérée comme sujet (p.e. G. Poulet) à la tendance formalisante (nous pensons particulièrement à L. Spitzer et au New Criticism). Mais ce n'est que l'analyse structurale qui pousse au bout cette objectivation puisque elle n'est pas seulement classificatoire mais aussi réductioniste. 2. Nous supposons l'homologie totale de la littérature et du langage : le récit est un discours linguistique. La possibilité d'une étude structurale du récit dépend donc de la possibilité de la sémantique. On connaît les difficultés que cette science linguistique de la signification rencontre dans l'élaboration de sa méthode : ni l'analyse distributionnelle (Z. Harris), ni l'analyse sémique (A. Greimas) ne se déroulent complètement à l'intérieur de la linguistique. Ce n'est que la grammaire generative de N. Chomsky, cette syntaxe créatrice qui décrit les structures qui rendent possible toute signification sémantique, qui fait entrevoir une solution au problème. Cette étude de l'activité dynamique du langage ou des conditions de possibilité de la signification affirme la primauté de la syntaxe sur la sémantique. Le récit, comme chaque discours, est, quant à sa structure, analogique et homologiqu<br>

Article Title: Theorizing Narrative Identity: Symbolic Interactionism and Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i383167<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: Although Shaw may be many admirable things, he is not a university-trained philosopher of hermeneutics and phenomenology. Ricoeur is. Yet when it comes to contemplating matters of faith and hope, little of consequence, if anything, separates the two, in terms of both substance and method. To begin with, the first presupposition Shaw employs to orient himself to existence is the same as Ricoeur's: the unsullied innocence of creation. Every infant, according to Shaw, is an “experiment … a fresh attempt to produce the just man made perfect: that is, to make humanity divine.”
         
               Each child, Shaw says, possesses a “divine spark,” a “vital impulse” that impels it “towards perfection.”38
            
               In all children, then, latent divinity lies dormant, awaiting cultivation by the guardians of civilization. In other words, the good toward which the budding vanguards of the future instinctively aspire is not wholly outside them. It also lives within them: it is encoded on the helical strands of their DNA.39
            
               For Shaw, the deific imprint of all that is virtuous and consecrated in the world inheres uncorrupted in the human genome.40<br>
