  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: As a result of the preceding chapter, we can see how the category of the penultimate allows us to affirm human capability yet also discern the limits of human capability and avoid a synergistic confusion of divine and human agency. The ultimate word is pronounced from beyond the self and its immanent possibilities and capacities, but within the horizon of the penultimate the self is
                  homo capax. We can therefore identify the capacities that Ricoeur discusses in his phenomenology ofl’homme capable—speaking, acting, narrating, and assuming responsibility—as penultimate capacities. If time permitted it would be worthwhile to examine<br>

  Book Title: Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Tattam Helen<br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) stands outside the traditional canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. Where he is not simply forgotten or overlooked, he is dismissed as a ‘relentlessly unsystematic’ thinker, or, following Jean-Paul Sartre’s lead, labelled a ‘Christian existentialist’ — a label that avoids consideration of Marcel’s work on its own terms. How is one to appreciate Marcel’s contribution, especially when his oeuvre appears to be at odds with philosophical convention? Helen Tattam proposes a range of readings, as opposed to one single interpretation: a series of departures or explorations that bring Marcel’s work into contact with critical partners such as Henri Bergson, Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Lévinas and other insights into a host of twentieth-century philosophical shifts concerning time, the subject, the other, ethics, and religion.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and Hermeneutics in Our Time-A Reader<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hyde Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: This thought-provoking book initiates a dialogue among scholars in rhetoric and hermeneutics in many areas of the humanities. Twenty leading thinkers explore the ways these two powerful disciplines inform each other and influence a wide variety of intellectual fields. Walter Jost and Michael J. Hyde organize pivotal topics in rhetoric and hermeneutics with originality and coherence, dividing their book into four sections: Locating the Disciplines; Inventions and Applications; Arguments and Narratives; and Civic Discourse and Critical Theory.Contributors to this volume include Hans-Georg Gadamer (one of whose pieces is here translated into English for the first time), Paul Ricoeur, Gerald L. Bruns, Charles Altieri, Richard E. Palmer, Calvin O. Schrag,.Victoria Kahn, Eugene Garver, Michael Leff, Nancy S. Streuver, Wendy Olmsted, David Tracy, Donald G. Marshall, Allen Scult, Rita Copeland, William Rehg, and Steven Mailloux.For readers across the humanities, the book demonstrates the usefulness of rhetorical and hermeneutic approaches in literary, philosophical, legal, religious, and political thinking. With its stimulating new perspectives on the revival and interrelation of both rhetoric and hermeneutics, this collection is sure to serve as a benchmark for years to come.<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a world without narrative: In our individual lives as well as in the history of humankind, narratives and storytelling are omnipresent. None of the other modes of symbolic communication “feels” as innately human as the synthetic sequencing of causally related events along a time line. In fact, as the French literary theorist and philosopher Paul Ricoeur argued in his seminal three-volume
                     Time and Narrative(1984), the human experience of time itself seems to be bound to our ability to narrate.<br>

  Abstract: Change or consistency in one’s moral self over time was a major theme of the men’s stories. This theme is not surprising given the use of narrative in explaining oneself (Ricoeur 1984) and thus establishing a cohesive self over time (Linde 1993; McAdams 1999), and cues to crime or sanctions that I gave the men (e.g., “How did you get here?”), however neutral and universal I believed them to be at the time. At two archetypical extremes, I heard

Bearing spirited witness to this is a long passage in part 3 of Memory, History, Forgetting, devoted to “the historical condition,” in which the philosopher of memory and history considers in his turn the identification of death with “the intimate possibility of one’s ownmost potentiality of being,” and opposes to it “an alternative reading of the potentiality of dying.”¹ However, as Ricœur was writing<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: This account of illocutionary force is particularly suited to illuminating struggles for recognition on the part of women who have often entered the public sphere only through the narrative form, in novels, biographies, and autobiographies. Lara is particularly interested in the way in which women take up each other’s lives to make moral claims and to fashion and refashion identities. Hannah Arendt looks at the life of Rahel Varnhagen in order to assume her own identity as a pariah, as a Jew, and as a woman; later, contemporary feminists take up Arendt’s identity as reflected in her biography of Varnhagen to fashion their own. Simone de Beauvoir creates a fictional self to sort through her lived relationship to Jean Paul Sartre, which then becomes the site for contemporary feminists to sort through their own identity and autonomy. This loop occurs repeatedly in what Lara, following Ricoeur, sees as a tripartite mimesis. In mimesis 2, Jane Austen takes up the limited life of the women of her time (mimesis 1) to construct an identity for women that is then taken up again by contemporary women in films of Jane Austen’s novels (mimesis 3) to continue to construct that identity. Moreover, what is told in these looping narratives is the way in which women are and become moral agents. Thus, while many commentators have associated Austen only with Aristotle, with an ethics of virtue, Lara is just as interested in the morality of principle that Austen’s heroines exhibit. Moreover, she emphasizes the extent to which the moral claims Austen raises are validated through the narrative structure of her novels. This is a relationship that Martha Nussbaum also articulates, as Lara notes. For both, it is through the structure of narrative and imaginative speech that moral claims become not only rationally justified but compelling as well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur turns to Walzer’s work, then, not to move from a Rawlsian liberalism to communitarianism but to look at another question: that of the divisibility of principles of justice within a particular state. Again Ricoeur emphasizes the importance of political community. He thinks Walzer errs in viewing the question of politics solely as a question of the just distribution of political power since, in doing so, he fails to examine the status of the political community within which distributions proceed. Ricoeur acknowledges the attention Walzer pays to questions of membership in a political community. Still, he thinks that what Walzer’s work illuminates is “the uncomfortable situation of an entity called upon to behave at the same time as the whole and as the part, as the container and the contained, as inclusive agency and an included region” (p. 93). Rather than moving to a more communitarian view, then, Ricoeur accepts a modified version of Rawlsian liberalism: Rawls successfully constructs a single set of principles of justice, and we need only recognize that the grounds for this selection lie in our preexisting conception of the good rooted in our aspirations for meaningful lives and friendships within just institutions.<br>

Issue: jmh.2004.76.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1997<br>
Author(s): Woodall Christopher <br>
Abstract: The two volumes under review here expand on these valuable historical insights. The first collection of essays, edited by Roger Chartier and his Italian counterpart, Guglielmo Cavallo, is very nearly a comprehensive overview of the issues, the sources, and the literature in the field from ancient Greece to the twentieth‐century Internet. Eleven prominent scholars join Chartier and Cavallo in an assessment of developments in their various specialties. Despite considerable differences in approach—linguistic, etymological, ethnographic, material, theological, social, and economic, among others—the essays share some themes, which the editors summarize well in their introduction. Historically speaking, a text written is not a text read; it does not speak for itself; readers must first give it meaning, which is often far removed from what the author had intended. As Paul Ricoeur put it in his
      Time and Narrative(trans. Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, 3 vols. [Chicago, 1984–88]), the world of the text and the world of the reader are not one and the same, and their relationship does not remain the same over time. Historians of the book, like Henri‐Jean Martin, have attended well to the changing modalities of the material text; historians of literacy, like François Furet and Jacques Ozouf, have also considered the limitations of textual reception; but only recently have historians pondered how historical changes in printed matter affected the way it was received, as Donald F. McKenzie recommends in his bibliographic sociology of texts. Similarly, historians have finally learned to take seriously the historical implications of Stanley Fish’s interpretive communities, whose predispositions to texts have a life of their own independent of the texts themselves in ways that can be traced over time. In this, we are at a considerable distance from the philological obsessions of nineteenth‐century literary scholarship.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): Jones Bonna<br>
Abstract: A text transcends its own production; specifically, it transcends the psychological and sociological conditions of its own production. Ricoeur shows how this semantic autonomy is threefold in nature [
         21]. First, there is autonomy from the intentions of the author; in other words, what the text signifies is no longer what the author intended. We could say that the author has limited control over the meaning that the reader appropriates. Second, a text becomes autonomous with respect to the cultural situation and the social conditions that pertained at the time of production. Third, the audience for whom the text was written is transient; unlike dialogue, the original addressee is no longer present. Ricoeur argues that “the work itself creates an audience, which potentially includes anyone who can read” [41, p. 298], and he suggests that a text is open to an unlimited series of readings.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In this chapter, Ricoeur displays an artful capacity to inspire the ongoing research on recognition. Many contemporary thinkers have chosen to shun the troubling question of “What is it that must be recognized?” with something akin to an institutional approach: the answer would not lie in discovering the essence of recognition but, instead, in finding a creative approach to the negotiation of recognition claims. This approach is clearly the one preferred in the defense of multiculturalism. For instance, Will Kymlicka emphasizes the design of fair “structures of culture” that are distinguished from substantial “characters of culture” (Will Kymlicka,
      Liberalism, Community, and Culture[New York: Clarendon, 1989], 167). The idea behind this separation of political from more substantive problems is, most of the time, congruent with considerations about the pluralism of worldviews and the public role of philosophy. Yet this approach, however sound it may be, has displaced deep conflicts in the hands of institutional “designs” that are guided by the need for immediate results, which are likely to shade important issues.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Practical and Normative Ethics for Librarianship<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Over time, statements such as the LBR have been discussed and alternatives weighed, but librarianship’s discursive practice has, in recent years, largely constituted an orthodoxy that may not be sensitive or responsive to disputation. One voice of this orthodoxy is Robert Hauptman, who writes, “We are free to articulate anything we imagine” [
         30, p. 18], and “If there are more fundamental rights than freedom of thought, then anyone, naturally, can cite those rights when attempting to control what students may read in a class, what libraries may collect, and what Americans may access on the Internet” [30, p. 138]. His first idea is incorrect; there are, in fact, laws that limit what a person can say. Paradoxically, Hauptman also argues against research misconduct on the grounds of responsibility and public interest, but if we are indeed free to say anything we can imagine, we can lie and falsify with impunity. The positive ethos of research integrity is indisputable; violation of the ethos can cause harm. That positive ethos does, however, come into conflict with Hauptman’s first maxim. His second claim is puzzling; if there are more fundamental rights, then those rights probably should supersede a right to access to information. For example, a right to privacy trumps another’s “right” to certain of an individual’s personal information. A right to freedom from harm trumps a person’s “right” to libel another intentionally and with malice. Hauptman also proposes that, in combating censorship, the minority cannot dictate to the majority. However, Paul Ricoeur, arguing for the kind of normative ethics suggested here, says, “Whoever might be a victim must not be sacrificed to the benefit of some common good. This is the anti‐utilitarian point of the Rawlsian theory of justice” [31, p. 65]. It is obvious that the whims of the minority should not hold sway simply because they wish it to be so, but, likewise, the majority should not be able to cause harm to others o~<br>

Abstract: Popkin defines such autobiographies as published personal narratives in which professional historians discuss first and foremost their lives. His corpus includes close to four hundred book‐length and shorter texts by Western historians—essentially Americans and Europeans. Following Paul Ricoeur, Popkin emphasizes the literary autonomy of autobiography. While it shares traits with history and fiction, this “hybrid genre” alone brings together “an unstable mixture of fabulation and actual experience,” an independence from documentation, an investigation into “the inner experience of time,” a lack of closure, and an ability to supplement reality through rhetorical transformation (45, 47).<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: In this revised dissertation, W. David Hall argues that Paul Ricoeur’s religious writings can offer an important context for interpreting his philosophical project—that, in fact, Ricoeur’s philosophical writings take on more of a theological tenor over time, especially if one focuses on their growing emphasis on ethics. This development, Hall argues, culminates in a creative tension between love and justice that finds its peak in a confrontation between the ideas of autonomy and theonomy. “The love command lends an imperative structure to the ideal of love that opens it to moral judgment in general and ideals of justice in particular” (2), yet without turning into something reducible to the Kantian notion of a moral categorical imperative. Rather, what is at issue is a “poetic” use of the imperative in Ricoeur’s thought.<br>

Abstract: Although Larmore’s version of narrative identity is plausible, he leaves it unclear how different “strands” of action can form parts of a single life: given that they have distinct goals (175), why do they not form different selves, unless there is an underlying unity of consciousness not constituted by shared ends or reasons? Similarly, while Ricoeur is correct to say that the possibility of my coinciding with a future person depends on whether there is a “series of commitments” that could make sense of a development from my present orientations to this future configuration (174), it seems implausible that I retrace such developments “in a flash” when involuntarily recalling a very different weave of interests, concerns, beliefs, and ways of being that were mine in a far past (176). Larmore is more convincing in his argument that it may be a mistake to try to control the whole course of one’s life through a “life plan” since much of value in life depends on surprise (179–81). He raises interesting questions about the value of reflection on the whole course of one’s life, given the limits to our agendas and the need for openness to the unexpected (178–85). Yet some perspective on one’s life as a whole must be possible if the unity of practical identities over time has a narrative form. Larmore is surely correct that our affinities which interact with perceived objective goods to give us personal reasons “change over the course of our lives” (189), but that is at least partly because of acts of “will” or explicit resolves to follow certain norms (as Larmore admits: 173–74). Without this distinctive type of commitment, arguably we cannot explain narrative continuity across more dramatic changes in character traits or distinguish between narrative unity of the sort constitutive of selves in general and stronger forms of narrative unity associated with personal autonomy.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Author(s): Hodder Ian<br>
Abstract: Archaeological periodization constructs narratives with beginnings, middles and ends. But the material culture on which such narratives are built is also involved in narratives according to which past agents lived their lives. According to Ricoeur, such lived narratives are also related to agents' practical experience of time. As archaeologists we have to 'read' past narratives through the rhetoric by which they were expressed. While Hayden White's scheme for temporal cycles of rhetoric is rejected, the sequence of material culture at Sitagroi is examined in order to explore the relationships between the plots written by archacologists and those lived by past agents at the site. Past and present concepts of time are embedded in different narratives and expressed through different rhetorics, but some interaction between the two is possible.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010370<br>

Author(s): Piercey Robert<br>
Abstract: While it is clear that the Gadamer-Habermas debate has had a major influence on Paul Ricoeur, his commentators have had little to say about the nature of this influence. I try to remedy this silence by showing that Ricoeur's account of tradition is a direct response to the Gadamer-Habermas debate. First, I briefly explain the debate's importance and describe Ricoeur's reaction to it. Next, I show how his discussion of tradition in Time and Narrative steers a middle course between Gadamerian hermeneutics and Habermasian Ideologiekritik. Finally, I raise some critical questions about the adequacy of Ricoeur's middle course. Specifically, I argue that it rests on an implausible distinction between the form and the content of tradition.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: If Descartes's "Cogito" can be held as the opening of the era of modern subjectivity, it is to the extent that the "I" is taken for the first time in the position of foundation, i.e., as the ultimate condition for the possibility of all philosophical discourse. The question raised in this paper is whether the crisis of the "Cogito", opened later by Hume, Nietzsche and Heidegger on different philosophical grounds, is not already contemporaneous to the very positing of the "Cogito".<br>

Article Title: A Principle of Text Coherence in Indonesian Languages<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Article Title: A Coincidence of Metaphors: Notes on Two Modes of Text Building in the Indonesian Novel "Surabaya"<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Jeff<br>
Abstract: This article suggests that two distinct modes of text-building constraints coincide in the Indonesian novel "Surabaya." The first set of constraints consists of narrative functions that shape sentence-level grammar within the story; the second level of text-building constraints shapes the thematic structure of the story. The author argues that, unlike its narrative structure, which is bound by the linearity of time, the thematic structure, of "Surabaya" is defined by a hierarchy of "heavier" and "lighter" themes, the "heavier" themes being evoked more often than are the "lighter" themes. He suggests that heaviness of theme is a strategy of text building found in classical Malaysian (Hikayat) texts, gamelan orchestra musical organization, and in calendric reckoning in much of Indonesia. He argues, in sum, for a method of writing that encourages grammatical description from two or more perspectives. "Binocular vision," to use Gregory Bateson's words, is necessary in writing to provide a more honest, richer description of a text than a single mode of grammatical description can provide; it makes available to readers more than one means of access to the text.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: מסה זו עוסקת בסוציולוגיה של התרגום בתנאים של יחסי כוח תיאולוגיים וקולוניאליים בין שפות. בעקבות ולטר בנימין, פול ריקר, ז'אק דרידה והספרות הפוסט-קולוניאלית, אדגים כיצד תחומים בלתי ניתנים לתרגום הופכים את התרגום לאשליה משיחית. דרך דוגמאות מתוך ספרות הנכבה שנכתבה בערבית אני מבקש להראות כיצד התחומים הבלתי ניתנים לתרגום מוצפים במסמנים לא יציבים ובמצבים אפורתיים של מבוי סתום. למשל, השימוש במילה נכבה אינו עקבי אלא תלוי בהקשר של זמן הכתיבה וזמן התרגום. בערבית אפשר למצוא לבד מנכבה גם את המושגים כארת'ה, הזימה, נכסה ומאסאה. בעברית אפשר למצוא שימוש באסון, בתבוסה, בטרגדיה או בנכבה. גם המסמנים ההיסטוריוגרפיים ומסמני הזמן והמרחב בספרות הנכבה אינם יציבים אלא משתנים תמידית. תובנות אלה מציעות אסטרטגיות תרגום שמתבססות על הטיות זמן מתאימות (למשל זמן הווה מתמשך במקום זמן עבר), על היעזרות בהערות חיצוניות לטקסט ועל שערוב מסוים של העברית. What is translation under asymmetrical conditions of power? How do colonial and theological practices shape the relationships between languages? Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Jacque Derrida, and postcolonial literature in general, I show how untranslatable texts stemming from such asymmetry result in insurmountable gaps which render the messianic "perfect translation" impossible. Using examples from literature on the Palestinian Naqba, I examine how untranslatable texts (from Arabic to Hebrew) are inflated with unstable signifiers, which themselves are contingent on the time/space aspect of the translation. Using these examples, I demonstrate the extent to which translation from Arabic to Hebrew necessitates peculiar political and aesthetic strategies which are sensitive to colonial and theological conditions.<br>

Abstract: Going beyond the passing theological fashions, the article seeks to show the relevance of "narrative theology". It first illustrates its doctrinal foundation in the many narratives which provide the frame-work for the biblical books, in the narrative of the Creed itself, in the ancient theologies of salvation history, down to the rediscovery of "narrativity" in contemporary theology. It then seeks to throw light on the philosophical foundation of narrative theology relying on Gaston Fessard's reflexion on three histories, natural, human and supernatural, and of Paul Ricoeur on Temps et récit (Time and Narrative), history and narrative, narrative and freedom. It ends up with a pastoral anthropology of narrative which seeks the link and meeting-point between the narrative of salvation and our own stories.<br>

Author(s): Nebel Mathias<br>
Abstract: Cet article cherche à préciser, à partir de la foi, dans quelle mesure le Christ peut être dit Norme de notre vie et de l'Histoire. L'auteur articule sa réponse à partir de la théologie de la grâce de Von Balthasar, de la morale théonome de Tillich et de la réflexion de Ricoeur sur le rapport à autrui. L'auteur soutient qu'il est possible de comprendre l'agapè comme un impératif catégorique non seulement formel, mais également concret. L'acte de la rencontre du Christ, universalisé dans et par l'Esprit, est tout à la fois la forme et le contenu de l'impératif catégorique. Sous cet aspect la norme n'est plus imposition, mais interpellation eschatologique à laquelle le croyant répondra par une configuration de sa vie au Christ. The paper seeks to understand how Christ can be said to be the living Norm of our life and of our History. The author build his reply upon Von Balthasar theology of grace, Tillich's concept of theonomy and Ricoeur's concept of solicitude. He sustain that it is possible to understand the love of agape not only as a formal but also a concrete categorical imperative. The encounter, the very act of meeting Christ, universally broaden by the Spirit, is at the same time the form and the contend of the categorical imperative. Under this view, the norm is not anymore imposed to the believer as an obligation, but urged upon him as an eschatological invitation to love.<br>

Abstract: The new theology of revelation in dealing with the inspiration of the Scriptures has to face the problem of time. Such a theory should neither be based on the concept of a pure „inspiration at the beginning“ nor on the „inspiration of the reader“. Whilst the former alone is unsatisfactory the latter would abandon the normativity of Scriptures and Tradition. By drawing on some ideas of Paul Ricoeur, the article develops an understanding of inspiration that is guided by the concept of „pneumatological passivity“. This pneumatological perspective enables under the aspect of time a „narrative“ understanding of the identity of the church.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur delineates how self-relatedness is implied in domains of speech, action, narra-
tion, and communal (institutional) interaction — in speech by the use of performatives (prom-
ises, assertions, déclarations) which refer to the integrity (tnistworthiness) of the speaker; in
action by the fact that acts are not simply events in the world but présupposé agency and re-
sponsibility; in narration by the subtle dialectics between character and plot, a dialectic in
which the narrating self aims at coherence of the I-self relationship over time; and, at the
communal level, because larger communal wholes (institutions) maintain their moral identity
only in the openness to otherness.<br>

Article Title: Border Crossings: History, Fiction, and Dead Certainties<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Abstract: In "The University in Ruins", Bill Readings traces shifting ideas about the university from the writings of Kant and von Humboldt to their "ruins" in a managerial newspeak that prioritizes profitable programs over humanities scholarship and teaching. The author contends that Readings narrates the dehiscence of these ideas in the form of a lament, even as he urges humanities faculty to abandon melancholic fixations on our deteriorating prestige and besieged values. This article recasts Readings's account in light of Paul Ricoeur's explication of the Augustinian lament to speculate about the ontological lineaments of a sense of lost time among human scientists. يتتبع بيل ريدنجز في عمله أطلال الجامعة المفاهيم المتغيرة عن الجامعة ﺑﺎﺩﺋﺎً بكتابات كانط وڨون هومبولت ومنتهياً بظلال تلك المفاهيم في اللغة الٳدارية الدعاﺋﻴﺔ الحالية التي تتخذ من البرامج الأكاديمية المربحة أولوية لها، على حساب البحث العلمي والتدريس في مجال الٳنسانيات. وترى الكاتبة أن ريدنجز يسرد هذه التحولات في صيغة رثاء ﻳﺆﻛﺪ تراجعها، في الوقت الذي يحث فيه أساتذة الٳنسانيات على التخلي عن هوسهم السوداوي بمثاليات عفى عليها الزمن. وتعيد هذه المقالة تقديم عمل ريدنجز في ضوء شرح پول ريكور للرثاء الأوجسطيني، متأملة السمات الأنطولوجية التي تميز شعور علماء الٳنسانيات بالزمن المفقود .<br>

Abstract: Particular problems are posed in the study of lives since the course of life may be less continuous and predictable than sometimes assumed. Further, the most important aspect of developmental study may be the subjectively constructed narrative of development, or life history, which itself changes over personal and historical time. Following the interpretive approach pioneered by Dilthey, Weber, Freud, and, more recently, Ricoeur, Taylor, and others, lives may be considered as texts to be studied in a systematic manner. The concept of empathy as formulated within the clinical situation, and applied most recently to study of biography, may also foster understanding of changes over time in the life history.<br>

Article Title: Semantic Innovation: Arithmetical and Algebraic Metaphors within Narratives of Learning<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P. Ricoeur sous la perspective d'une logique de la production du sens, en discutant de façon critique les possibilités et les limites du cercle herméneutique. On prend comme point de départ les présupposés phénoménologiques et ontologiques de sa philosophie, pour aborder successivement les questions concernant l'interprétation textuelle, l'imagination et la créativité, l'action, le temps et le récit, l'idéologie et l'utopie. Tout en reconnaissant un certain logocentrisme–un mélange de Logos et de réalité supposée–impliqué dans la solution de ces questions qui nous est proposée par l'auteur, on cherche à repenser le lieu entre le sens et le consensus, la cohérence et la question même de la violence. A cet effet, la derniére section établit une confrontation entre les positions défendues par Ricoeur et l'hypothèse de R.

Abstract: Um filósofo com quem Paul Ricoeur manteve um interessante e fecundo relacionamento, durante mais de trinta anos, foi Gabriel Mareei, pensador de que se celebrou em 1989 o Centenário (7.121889 - 7.121989). Esta exposição procura evidenciar alguns aspectos filosóficos que Paul Ricoeur colhe na lição marceliana. Nesse sentido, a obra que serviu de fio condutor a esta reflexão foi publicada com o título "Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, que se constituiu como um diálogo discípulo-mestre, e isto a partir de algumas problemáticas que numa espécie de marceliano regard en arrière, surgem como correspondendo aos nós da filosofia de Gabriel Marcel. /// Un philosophe avec lequel Paul Ricoeur a maintenu durant plus de trente ans des rapports intéressants aussi bien que féconds est Gabriel Marcel, penseur dont on vient de célébrer en 1989 le Centenaire (7.121889–7.121989). Le présent exposé se fait dans le but de mettre en évidence certains aspects philosophiques que Paul Ricoeur emprunte de la leçon marcélienne. L'ouvrage servant de fil conducteur pour ces réflexions, qui a été publié sous le titre Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, assume la forme d'un dialogue disciple-maître, en partant de certaines problématiques qui, par une espèce de marcélien regard en arrière, correspondent à vrai dire aux noeuds de la philosophie de Gabriel Marcel. /// Gabriel Marcel is a philosopher with whom Paul Ricoeur and mantained one interesting relationship for more than thirty years. This article seeks to present those aspects of Ricoeur's philosophy which have Marcel as their source. The work that serves as a base for understanding this relationship is Entretiens Paul Rtcoeur-Gabriel Marcel in essence a dialogue between a disciple and his mentor. At the same time, this dialogue reveals the fundamental future of Gabriel Marcel's philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, literature is the destiny of writing separated from myth. Icons, which are, in Greek or Russian, not painted but written, and whose particularity is to exactly coincide with sacred myth, can represent an inaccessible limit for writing — a transcendent, utterly symbolic writing. And yet Ricoeur compares poetic writing at its least referential, at its most opaque, with icons... The role of icons in the works of Georges Schehadé and Lorand Gaspar shows that the icon, like the myth, has over time become opaque, lost its referential transparency, while still representing the permanently disappointed aspiration of literature to myth; thus their poetics seem to compensate the loss of meaning by rewriting icons, in particular through the work of the artisan as depicted by Gaspar.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: The study of biography as an exercise in sociology has been under-used. The early proponents of a sociology of biography -most notably Wilhelm Dilthey -have not had their work greatly developed. However, with the emergence of Paul Ricoeur's work on the nature of narrativity, time and interpretation, plus the developing influence of the work of others, a hermeneutics of biography has now begun. This paper explores this development, and, further, briefly examines two highly important biographies to explore how theoretical injunction is matched by empirical practice.<br>

Abstract: Os direitos humanos precisam ser repensados em tempos de crescente suspeição teórica e prática. Neste artigo, procura-se contribuir para a reflexão sobre os direitos humanos a partir do contraste entre duas alternativas teóricas, aqui representadas pelas propostas divergentes de Marie-Bénédicte Dembour e Paul Ricoeur. A primeira caracteriza-se por desenvolver uma visão niilista dos direitos humanos, que pressupõe a negação de qualquer fundamento aos direitos humanos para além da retórica ocidental. A segunda apresenta-se como uma nova confiança hermenêutica, assentada na riqueza e na fragilidade das promessas de direitos subjacentes às declarações universais dos direitos humanos. Do contraste entre essas duas perspectivas, espera-se evidenciar que a intensificação das suspeitas sobre o que se constata na teoria e na prática dos direitos humanos exige sempre do filósofo uma nova atestação do que é fundamentalmente digno do humano nos direitos humanos. Human rights need to be rethought in a time of increasing theoretical and practical suspicion. In this article, we seek to contribute to the reflection on human rights, from the contrast between two theoretical alternatives, here represented by the divergent approaches of Marie-Bénédicte Dembour and Paul Ricoeur. The first is characterized by the development of a nihilistic view of human rights, which presupposes the denial of any ground for human rights beyond western rhetoric. The second presents itself as a new hermeneutic confidence, grounded in the richness and fragility of the promises of rights underlying the universal declarations of human rights. From the contrast between these two perspectives, we hope to show that the intensification of suspicions about the theory and practice of human rights requires always from the philosopher a new attestation of what is fundamentally worthy of the human nature in the human rights.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, pr~<br>

Article Title: The contours of memory in post-conflict societies: enacting public remembrance of the bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland<br>

Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: It seems to me that this provides the basis for a good answer to the question that was posed at the outset of this article, that is: “Is a hermeneutic phenomenology ‘wide open’ enough for a minimal phenomenology?” This is indeed the case. For, just as Freud's mixed discourse means that each discourse points to a discourse outside itself, the same could be said of the relation between Deleuze and phenomenology.
      
               The key here is to recognize that the nonsignifying or the impersonal is on the way to meaning and on the way to consciousness. And at the same time, phenomenological discourse necessarily points back to a nonsignifying or impersonal reality that precedes and gives rise to it. The role of a hermeneutic phenomenology is to mediate between these two discourses by traveling along this path back and forth between meaning and its becoming, following its composition and decomposition in the movement from sense to non-sense, from the impersonal to the personal, from the formless to form—and back again.26<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>

Abstract: In a period of immanent crisis when comprehensive historical narratives are no longer possible—nor is utopia—dystopia, or rather uchronia tinged with dystopia, seems to be a rather effective means to construct a sweeping historical narration. Through the “timeless time” of uchronia in which—as Ricoeur explains in
         Time and Narrative(vol. III)—“we are torn between two fleeing horizons” so that “our present sees itself in crisis,” Roth looks back at a counterfactual past in order to better investigate historical causality and to embrace past and present into a postmodern problematic perspective on the temporal dimension.<br>
