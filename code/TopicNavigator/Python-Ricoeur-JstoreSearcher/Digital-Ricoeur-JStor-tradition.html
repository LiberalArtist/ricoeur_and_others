  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these <br>

  Abstract: The title of Calvin Schrag’s splendid little book
                  The Self after Postmodernity¹ makes explicit his assumption that the postmodern assault on the self as conceived by major strands within the western philosophical tradition is not an abolition, not a annihilation without remainder. Schrag’s work is inspired in large part by Paul Ricoeur’s attempt, among the shards of the “shattered cogito,” to develop a “hermeneutics of the self [that] is placed at an equal distance from the apology of the cogito and from its overthrow … at an equal distance from the cogito exalted by Descartes and from the cogito that<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Abstract: ‘A period of experimentation of all types’ – with these terms the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur once described the interwar years through which he had lived as a young man.¹ Tomás Masaryk, just installed as first president of the new Czechoslovak state, thought post-1918 Europe a ‘laboratory built over the great graveyard of the World War’.² Europeans were partly forced to experiment because both tradition and dynastic legitimacy had ceased to provide principles for public order, but new ones had hardly become entrenched.

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: The Christian tradition supports such a view by qualifying human agency or freedom with humanity's primordial fallibility and, hence, ultimate dependence on sources of meaning larger than itself. For Ricoeur this means that love for others is not just an autonomous act (as in the classic Enlightenment ethics of Immanuel Kant) but also the placing of ultimate faith in an already given goodness of creation. As he puts it, moral agency takes place within the context of an “economy of the gift” in which the reception of a sense of one’s own “given” human goodness makes it possible in turn to imagine resisting one’s own participation in evil and “giving” a more superabundant love to others.
         42Or, as Kearney has similarly put it, moral life should involve neither pure agency nor pure prostration before the other—each of which he calls a form of “idolatry”—but rather a constantly self‐transforming “practical wisdom” that seeks through love of others ever broader “interlacings of alterities.”43If the Christian tradition has sometimes moved too far away from agency by emphasizing self‐sacrifice, a hermeneutical perspective reminds us instead that love is ultimately interactive, mutual, responsive, and productive of new social relations.<br>

Abstract: These poetic hermeneutical perspectives from Ricoeur, Kearney, and McFague help us reimagine the relation of ethics to poetics in a different way than in the powerful and continuing legacy of Platonism. Poetics is more here than either the Greek and premodern imitation of visible actions or the modern (aesthetic) perception of worldly appearances. It instead includes a fundamental, original, and necessarily invisible human moral capability to create social relations that are new and hitherto unimagined. This new poetic hermeneutics in effect recasts the old tradition of the
         imitatio Dei. It suggests—or rather affirms—that creating new moral worlds expresses a human capability that, however lost and corrupt, remains also primordially human. In mythical terms, poetics remains as humankind’s potential for the finite imitation of the world’s original Creator.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 518276<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Author(s): Bender Thomas<br>
Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END <br>

Publisher: American Historical Association<br>
Issue: 587015<br>
Date: April 2003<br>
Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Throughout the work, his approach is one that focuses on the key thinkers in the history of Western thought so as to illuminate the continuities and changes within the understanding of hermeneutics. Friedrich Schleiermacher, for instance, is named as the first turning point for inaugurating the modern subjective turn in hermeneutics by shifting its task from “rules of interpretation” to the “art of understanding.” He names Hans-Georg Gadamer as the second turning point for retrieving and rehabilitating notions of community, authority, history, and tradition for a more robust and rounded theory of hermeneutics. In addition to Schleiermacher and Gadamer, Thistleton accordingly devotes substantial sections and even separate chapters to other key thinkers in modern hermeneutics such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Ricoeur. Thistleton is at his best in this work when he gives the sustained attention and acute analyses that these seminal thinkers in modern and contemporary hermeneutics deserve.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: irqr.2008.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 05 2008<br>
Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p<br>

Author(s): Piercey Robert<br>
Abstract: While it is clear that the Gadamer-Habermas debate has had a major influence on Paul Ricoeur, his commentators have had little to say about the nature of this influence. I try to remedy this silence by showing that Ricoeur's account of tradition is a direct response to the Gadamer-Habermas debate. First, I briefly explain the debate's importance and describe Ricoeur's reaction to it. Next, I show how his discussion of tradition in Time and Narrative steers a middle course between Gadamerian hermeneutics and Habermasian Ideologiekritik. Finally, I raise some critical questions about the adequacy of Ricoeur's middle course. Specifically, I argue that it rests on an implausible distinction between the form and the content of tradition.<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>

Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Author(s): MARION MATHIEU<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: Over the course of an academic career that involved many ups and downs, and many dislocations, SPEP has remained a constant, a place of refuge almost, where I could be recognized and accepted. Many friendships were formed and continued there, and after a time the possibility of seeing friends became a major reason for attending. It's strange that SPEP can seem like a fixed place to which one returns again and again, even though it is a movable feast held each year in a different place. In a certain sense arriving at SPEP each year is “getting back into place,” to plagiarize a well-known phenomenologist, even though we may be in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, or even (if we can find it) Penn State. Its heart and soul, of course, remains the exchange of ideas built around a common tradition: ideas, texts, philosophers. As important in the history of SPEP has been the appearance among us of some of the most important European philosophers of these last fifty years: We were too late to lure Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty to our shores, but we heard Gadamer, Arendt, Ricoeur, Habermas, Derrida, and many more.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm<br>

Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat<br>
