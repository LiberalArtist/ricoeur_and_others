  Book Title: Between Vision and Obedience - Rethinking Theological Epistemology-Theological Reflections on Rationality and Agency with Special Reference to Paul Ricoeur and G.W.F. Hegel<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Ille George<br>
  Abstract: The present study seeks to respond theologically to current discussions about ideas of self from the perspective of God’s action in and towards the world. Its aim is to trace a view of rationality that follows the drama of God’s engagement with the world, thus involving dying and resurrection, ascesis and abundance, suffering witness and Eucharistic communion. Since, as Calvin notes, knowledge of God and knowledge of self are intimately bound together, this exercise of discerning the shape of a theological rationality in the present arena of competing promises of meaning and truth is carried out on two levels: the theological and the anthropological.<br>

  Abstract: To turn from nineteenth-century Congregationalism to Anglicanism, and especially Anglo-Catholicism, is in many ways to turn from what David Tracy, working from Paul Ricoeur, calls proclamation to what he calls manifestation, or from a dialectical toward an analogical imagination and language.¹ Congregationalism, we have seen, grounds the Christ-event as a Word-event, thus calling Christians to witness to that central experience in further, often dialectical, word and action. Anglicanism historically also values proclamation, with Scripture and sermon integral to its liturgy; as Tracy points out, the Christian faith has historically held that “Jesus Christ is both the decisive word and the<br>

  Author(s) Derrida Jacques<br>
  Abstract: For Paul Ricoeur, as for Sartre, Levinas, Patočka, and Derrida, sections 46 through 53 of 
                  Being and Time, on the existential analytic of Being-toward-death, constitute one of the most acutely confrontational passages of Heidegger’s formidable book. Bearing spirited witness to this is a long passage in part 3 of Memory, History, Forgetting, devoted to “the historical condition,” in which the philosopher of memory and history considers in his turn the identification of death with “the intimate possibility of one’s ownmost potentiality of being,” and opposes to it “an alternative reading of the potentiality of dying.”¹ However, as Ricœur was writing<br>

Article Title: The Syntax of Objects and the Representation of History: Speaking of "Slavery in New York"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>

Abstract: The representation of history continues to evolve in the domain of museum exhibitions. This evolution is informed in part by the creation of new display methods-many of which depart from the traditional conventions used to achieve the "museum effect"-in part by an increased attention to the museum-visitor relationship. In this context the ethical force of bearing witness, at times a crucial aspect of the museum experience, has emerged as a particularly compelling issue. In seeking to represent and address atrocity, injustice, and the abrogation of human rights, museums have the potential to become "sites of conscience" and to encourage "historical consciousness." Through a series of three exhibitions devoted to slavery, the New-York Historical Society demonstrated how such sites can be constructed and how objects can be deployed to represent extreme or "limit cases." In this review/essay I investigate and interrogate these exhibitions, looking closely at the use of objects as a source of "indirect testimony" (Marc Bloch) and at the "dialogical situation" (Paul Ricoeur) that might arise in an encounter among objects, exhibit narratives, and visitors. Thinking in terms of point of view, I look at the variety of rhetorical platforms from which objects speak in these exhibitions; thinking in terms of syntax, I look at the effects of ordering and of the radical juxtaposition of objects; thinking in terms of irony, I look at the provocations of double-voiced narratives and at how objects are used to support those historical sentences.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>

Abstract: And this is precisely where the specifically tragic enters the equation—Shaw was no fool. Yes, left to its own devices, evolution would proceed undeterred, in an upward trajectory of increasing complexity. Shaw was certain about this, but whether humankind would be around to witness the results remained for him a very open question. What preoccupied Shaw the most about the future was not that the species seemed to be sprinting toward the abyss in a mad dash to deliver itself single-handedly into extinction, although this was quite worrisome enough in his eyes. Rather, it was the agonizing fear of a potentially lethal incapacity lurking beneath the madness that drove him to the breaking point. More than anything, Shaw was desolated by the mounting evidence that suggested human beings were innately incapable of resolving the plethora of challenges confronting them with anything approaching justice and good common sense. As the years unfolded, he became increasingly fearful that no matter what remedial efforts were undertaken in the name of the sane society, nothing would avail. In his darkest moments, he came perilously close to believing that his fellow men and women were genetically unequipped to cope coherently with the exigencies of life. These severe doubts carried apocalyptic consequences with them. For if his worst nightmare truly mirrored reality, and every indication he had pointed in that direction, then there was in principle no remedy for the insanity, no way to heal the self-inflicted wounds that augured the arrival of oblivion. Divine intervention, in the traditional Western sense, was not an authentic possibility for him. He did not believe that some heavenly redeemer was waiting expectantly in the wings to make a grand, saving entrance. Only the drunken sea captain depends, misguidedly, on Providence to keep the rocks at a safe distance. Responsible skippers navigate. They do not drift aimlessly, as storm clouds gather and ominous waves swell. They ste<br>
