         <p>Pledging allegiance, singing the "Star-Spangled Banner," wearing a flag pin-these are all markers of modern patriotism, emblems that announce the devotion of American citizens. Most of these nationalistic performances were formulized during the early twentieth century and driven to new heights by the panic surrounding national identity during World War I. In<italic>To Become an American</italic>Leslie A. Hahner argues that, in part, the Americanization movement engendered the transformation of patriotism during this period. Americanization was a massive campaign designed to fashion immigrants into perfect Americans-those who were loyal in word, deed, and heart. The larger outcome of this widespread movement was a dramatic shift in the nation's understanding of Americanism. Employing a rhetorical lens to analyze the visual and aesthetic practices of Americanization, Hahner contends that Americanization not only tutored students in the practices of citizenship but also created a normative visual metric that modified how Americans would come to understand, interpret, and judge their own patriotism and that of others.</p>

                     <p>In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson declared Flag Day an official nationwide day of celebration. As United States involvement in the First World War loomed, the holiday became a spectacular affair showcasing American history, the dedication of the citizenry, and the nation’s preparedness for international conflict. The event was concurrently deemed Preparedness Day, a moniker emphasizing home-front readiness. Over 150 cities took up Wilson’s call, organizing parades, pageants, and other commemorations. The revelry followed the Lincoln Highway (a route that spanned from New York to San Francisco, somewhat following today’s I-80). Towns on this course arranged festivities, including lectures on American</p>

                     <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States faced one of the most dramatic transformations to its national identity. From the 1890s to the 1920s, nearly 23 million immigrants, largely from Europe, would constitute what Mirel deems “one of the largest migrations in human history.”¹ While the United States had long been a nation of immigrants, the vast numbers of arrivals from Southern and Eastern Europe presented a significant shift from previous generations. For some, this momentous change was cause for disapprobation. Leonard Dinnerstein and David Reimers explain that, often fleeing “horrendous conditions” of poverty, immigrants came with</p>

                     <p>In 1919, Raymond Crist, the director of citizenship in the Bureau of Naturalization, appeared before a House committee hearing on proposed changes to naturalization laws. In his opening statement, Crist suggested that the true import of his testimony was to praise the recent education initiatives of Americanization: “There is, however, a far greater subject which I should like to present to the committee for its most careful consideration. That subject is the all-absorbing, Nation-wide question rather loosely referred to by the term ‘Americanization.’”¹ For Crist, effective Americanization altered the hearts and minds of the unnaturalized. He explained, “Americanization work starts</p>

At one moment in the address, Governor Brumbaugh proposed a statewide housing code to preserve the health of the populace. As the governor affirmed the responsibilities of the state toward residents, he hailed proper living conditions as requisite to the production of stronger citizens. In particular, he heavily promoted these standards for the populace of ethnic neighborhoods, stating, “We are not Americanizing our new-coming immigrants if we allow them to live in what is often termed the ‘black</p>

While Wilson delivered the address mere days after the sinking of the<italic>Lusitania,</italic>he did not reference the attack by German U-boats, the nearly twelve hundred dead. Wilson asserted that the day’s celebration of naturalization emphasized the rebirth of the American spirit and the need for loyalty.

She directed readers, presumably club leaders and members, to find a “foreign girl” with whom you may “get acquainted with most easily.”¹ Ferris continued: “Ask her to introduce you to other foreign girls who she thinks would like to make the summer useful by learning more about America, by learning how to do something, and by having good times.”² For Ferris, girls’ clubs aided the acculturation of the “foreign girl” to the American way of life.

One of the proposals included in reconstruction enlarged funding and opportunities for Americanization. Proponents, progressive state legislators Abram Elkus and Felix Adler, sought to Americanize the least educated residents of the state. Their Americanization plans remained in keeping with the emotional nationalism of wartime programs. As they wrote in 1919,</p>

                     <p>In his 1915 Flag Day speech, President Wilson argued that the flag was an emblem of the nation’s possibilities. That token reminded citizens that “national life” was created not by abstract ideals, but by the “actual daily endeavors of a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals of honesty and righteousness and just conduct.”¹ His words tied behavior to national ideals—an association that heralded the actions of “sober, quiet” citizens, not “swashbuckler[s].”² His goal was to honor the quotidian nature of citizenship, those who did not attract attention to their patriotism</p>
