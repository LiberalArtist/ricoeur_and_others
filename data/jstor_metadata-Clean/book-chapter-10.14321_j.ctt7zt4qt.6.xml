         <p>For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In<italic>Intimate Domain,</italic>Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust's<italic>In Search of Lost Time,</italic>Sophocles's<italic>Antigone,</italic>and Julia Kristeva's<italic>The Old Man and the Wolves</italic>-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.</p>

                     <p>Marcel Proust’s<italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>is a powerful account of mimetic desire. Proust confronts us with the bankruptcy of the narrator’s desires as well as with our own; so also does he enable us to participate in the narrator’s release from the strictures of desire and his transformation. Chronicling hope and not only despair, the narrator of<italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>attests to salvation that is threaded through life trauma.</p>
                     <p>Tracking the narrator’s story across the pages of the novel, Girard offers a profound reading of<italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>. I appeal to that reading here,</p>

                     <p>According to Girard, an exploration of Proust’s<italic>In Search of Lost Time</italic>should not begin with the novel; rather, it should commence with reflection on a newspaper essay by Proust titled “Filial Sentiments of a Parricide.”¹ Girard argues that this essay constitutes a transformative moment for Proust, providing an occasion for him to break through the strictures of metaphysical desire that have mired him in ontological illness. Girard contends that, in the aftermath of writing this essay, Proust is newly able to identify with others in a nonrivalrous way. Further, Girard submits that insights Proust attains from the essay provide</p>

                     <p>My route forward with Proust begins with the madeleine. Girard cites the madeleine as a preliminary revelation for Proust—a “first glimmer of novelistic grace” for the novel that is to come—and Kristeva also begins her reflections on Proust with the madeleine.¹ However, because Kristeva draws out elements of this metaphor of which Girard takes no notice after he sets aside his early interest in affective memory and sensory experience, her observations can enhance Girard’s mimetic theory. Reflecting on the madeleine from a perspective grounded in Kristeva’s corporeal hermeneutics, I demonstrate how an augmented mimetic theory can offer a</p>

The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded</p>

As a consequence, our relations with siblings anticipate, for better or worse, later adult relationships. As we grow and our world expands beyond the immediate family to encompass other relationships, we may remain caught in rivalries that have characterized our initial relationship with our siblings. Or, diverging from that scenario, we may experience with our siblings and with others a supportive intimacy that enables us to overcome the effects of trauma and violence in our lives.</p>

But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to<italic>protect the singularity of human life</italic>.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical</p>

Compellingly demonstrated not only in<italic>Oedipus the King</italic>but also in<italic>Oedipus at Colonus</italic>, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipus<italic>is</italic>a polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ In<italic>Oedipus</italic>

And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis?

                     <p>T<italic>he Old Man and the Wolves</italic>begins with a tale called “The Invasion.” After crossing a frozen river and a windswept plain, wolves from the north now lurk on the edges of Santa Varvara seeking their prey. These “gray-coated, sharp-nosed carnivores, slinking singly or in packs through houses and gardens,” wear people’s faces and utter human speech.¹ Yet only the Old Man can see or hear them and smell their musky odor. Only he observes the marks their claws have made on the land and on the throats of “animals, birds, even women,”² and only he attributes increasing numbers of</p>

                     <p>Kristeva names the concluding section of<italic>The Old Man and the Wolves</italic>“Capriccio.” “Capriccio” focuses on multiple metamorphoses. Replicating and augmenting the transferential setting of the detective story, these changes radicalize its questions: What is the ultimate source of the contagion that has transformed Santa Varvara into a city of wolves? Can infected individuals be cured, or will they always be wolves? “Capriccio” investigates the possibility of<italic>reversible metamorphoses</italic>:<italic>C</italic>an those who have been contaminated by the wolves grasp their humanity again and break free of mimesis-driven scapegoating? Addressing this question are Stephanie, by means of her diary, and Kristeva,</p>
