         <p>
            <italic>Memory Work</italic>demonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,<italic>Memory Work</italic>draws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.</p>

                     <p>Late in her life, Anne Truitt shared a budding friendship with fellow minimal artist Carl Andre. In one of their conversations, Andre remarked on Truitt’s<italic>Catawba</italic>(1962; plate 9), a sculpture grouped with of one of his artworks at the Museum of Modern Art when it reopened in 2004 after its sweeping renovation. “It has ontology,” he said, adding: “It must have cost you to make it.” She received his words as a knowing smile between artists; only another artist could truly comprehend the intellectual and emotional energy suffused in the labor of making art.¹</p>

                     <p>In 1961, Anne Truitt made a sculpture, about fifty-four inches tall, called First (plate 1). Truitt’s title signaled a critical shift in which the artist broke away from the highly wrought sculptural experimentation characteristic of her style in the late 1950s and began to concentrate on formal simplicity. These concerns are articulated clearly in First, which is pared down to basics: three vertical, white, painted wooden planks cut to resemble the pickets of an iconic American picket fence. The simplicity of design and construction suggest that Truitt was forging connections to minimalism. Yet if we are to properly historicize First</p>

                     <p>When Anne Truitt revealed her sculpture Hardcastle (plate 6) to the art critic Clement Greenberg in her Washington, DC, studio in 1962, he backed away while muttering under his breath, “Scares the shit out of me.”¹ This comment is noteworthy, for it indexes the experiential profundity that led Greenberg later to comment favorably on this and other minimal-type works by Truitt.² Yet Greenberg’s remark is striking for another reason as well, in that it captures the essence of what Truitt began trying to do in 1962: to evoke viscerally embodied responses to her work without making the human body an</p>

                     <p>After his visit to Anne Truitt’s Twining Court studio in 1962, the critic Clement Greenberg made a bold assessment: “Now there will be three in Washington.”¹ His comment counted her in importance alongside the DC-based color field painters Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, who were prominently the subjects of his criticism, held in high esteem as the standard bearers of formalist modernism. Truitt, Louis, and Noland were also well known to one another in the tightly knit group of artists surrounding Washington’s Institute for Contemporary Art. Truitt rented the Twining Court studio, a coldwater carriage house, from Noland when he</p>

                     <p>Truitt had breakthroughs in Tokyo, but they were hard won. Despite the professional recognition that Truitt achieved while she lived in Japan from 1964 to 1967, it was a time of deep isolation, sadness, and frustration with her studio practice. At the turn of the 1970s, Truitt looked back on the sculptures she made in Japan and found them “simply intelligent,” “lifeless,” and inconsistent with the conceptual thrust of her work since First — and in December 1971, she had the majority of these Japanese works destroyed, nineteen sculptures in all.¹ Yet, despite this iconoclasm, after Truitt returned to the United</p>
