         <p>This new critical volume, the second to appear in the three-volume<italic>Lectura Dantis,</italic>contains expert, focused commentary on the<italic>Purgatorio</italic>by thirty-three international scholars, each of whom presents to the nonspecialist reader one of the cantos of the transitional middle cantica of Dante's unique Christian epic. The cast of characters is as colorful as before, although this time most of them are headed for salvation. The canto-by-canto commentary allows each contributor his or her individual voice and results in a deeper, richer awareness of Dante's timeless aspirations and achievements.</p>

                     <p>The<italic>Purgatorio</italic>opens with a solemn exordium, rich in anticipation and tension, that develops in three stages (1–12). First we are given the graceful but exultant image, dear to the mannerist tradition, of the “waters” and the “little vessel” that will “course” even as it “lifts her sail.” Next, the first-person narrator dramatically (“and what I sing”) offers the firm, clear definition of the theme. Finally, there is an invocation to the Muses recalling, like some mysterious legend, a famous episode in Ovid’s<italic>Metamorphoses.</italic>

                     <p>The action of Canto II is divided into four parts: lines 1–12, Dante and Virgil at the island’s shore; 13–51, the arrival of the angelic vessel; 52–117, Casella and Dante; and 118–133, Cato’s rebuke and the pilgrims’ departure.</p>
                     <p>The preeminent musicality of Canto II appears to continue the celebrative mood of the preceding canto, which is characterized by motifs such as rebirth, sweetness, delight, and freedom.

                     <p>In the concluding moments of Canto III, a figure appears who, while initially unidentified, is described by Dante with characteristic precision: “he was fair-haired and handsome and his aspect / was noble” (107–108). With an uncanny exactitude of attention, the figure before us is said to carry still on his body the physical scars of the battle in which his time on earth was ended. His brow is cleft: “but one eyebrow had been cleft” (108); and before he names himself the penitent displays a wound “high on his chest” (111). This figure, as one learns at line 112,</p>

An anecdote by the Anonymous Florentine is the archetype behind all the variations that appear throughout the fourteenth century and after, even into our own time:</p>

                     <p>In Canto V there appears none of those cruxes on which contemporary criticism often fastens as a basis for understanding the poem’s deeper meaning. Nevertheless, this canto contains some of the most vivid episodes of the journey, especially in its second part, which involves the stories of three memorable characters. As is typical of the whole<italic>cantica,</italic>and especially evident in the first cantos, we find that the three souls we meet here are, by the very definition of their realm, in a liminal state between two forms of existence, the earthly and the celestial.

                     <p>By the middle of the twentieth century, the critical question concerning Canto VI was no longer one of historical identification or aesthetic appreciation, but of whether the canto was substantially unified or, instead, contained a series of poetically unresolved issues. Aurelio Roncaglia, in his “Lectura Dantis” of 1955, showed that the repetition of disjunctive verbs such as<italic>si parte</italic>(“is done,” 1),<italic>disgiunto</italic>(“without a passageway,” 42),<italic>non m’accompagne</italic>(“not at my side,” 114), and<italic>scisso</italic>(“dissevered,” 123) creates a “convulsive marker” connecting the various parts of the canto.

                     <p>In the preceding canto, however willing he may be to answer Sordello’s rapid-fire questions, Virgil is allowed to utter “Mantua” and nothing more. No doubt he would have gone on reciting “me genuit” and the rest of the epitaph ascribed to him by Donatus and St. Jerome, but his reply is cut short by Sordello who, after revealing himself as a native of Mantua too, enfolds him in a most emotional hug.</p>
                     <p>Now, at the beginning of Canto VII, Dante is obviously expected to pick up the thread of the story at precisely the point where it had been cut</p>

                     <p>In the third hour of the night following his three days in Hell and a day in Ante-Purgatory, Dante sleeps in a flowering meadow. He feels mournful, like the swallow, which according to myth was once a ravished maiden. Probably at dawn, although the text allows the possibility that his vision lasts all night, he dreams that an eagle carries him up to the circle of fire. He compares himself to Ganymede, whom Jove, metamorphosed into an eagle, carried to the heavens, and then to Achilles, whom bright light awoke when he was carried to Sciros. When Dante revives he</p>

                     <p>Canto X begins the great cycle of penitence and education that characterizes Purgatory proper. The souls in Purgatory follow the order of the seven mortal sins as defined by Christian doctrine. They traverse the seven circles of the mountain, pausing in each circle, for a time, according to their inclination toward each sin that has remained in them after their life on earth. They are not punished for any specific crimes they may have committed, as happens in Dante’s Hell. Instead, at each stage of Purgatory, penitence regularly consists of a meditation and a<italic>contrapasso</italic>(a punishment suited to the</p>

We cannot even locate a dividing line between Cantos XI and XII (from the perspective of the narrative, at least); the borderline appears instead to be within the new canto, since the episode of the previous canto is yet to be completed. The poet is still accompanied by Oderisi da Gubbio, the miniaturist punished for his pride, with his back bent almost to</p>

                     <p>Of the various text divisions that have been suggested for Canto XIII, the best is perhaps Benvenuto’s three-part reading: the description of the place with its voices (1–42), the description of penance and purgation (43–72), and the conversation with “a modern spirit” (73–154). Like all the others, however, this division submerges the brief but eerie episode of Virgil’s prayer to the sun (10–23), which demands and will receive special treatment here.</p>

The solar light, which seems to be hitting the Pilgrim straight in the face, is so intense that he cannot help but shade his eyes. The Pilgrim forms a visor by putting his hand over his brow, but it is ineffectual, and he has to turn away from what he now likens to light reflected from a mirror or a mirrorlike surface.

                     <p>Many readers have been inclined to pass quickly over Canto XVIII, thinking its philosophical discussion of love and free will to be of little importance and finding no particularly significant character or event. To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the<italic>anima semplicetta</italic>(“soul is simple,”<italic>Purg.</italic>

                     <p>Canto XIX of the<italic>Purgatorio</italic>has not been among the most favored in terms of its readers’ attention. A survey of its critical history reveals, moreover, that readers have been attracted largely by one element, that of the dream of the siren with which the canto begins. The account of the pilgrim’s dream, however, occupies only nine tercets, or twenty-seven verses out of a total of 145. Even if we include in the episode the two introductory tercets that afford a temporal orientation, as well as the dreamer’s awakening to Virgil’s call and the latter’s explanation of the dream experience,</p>

                     <p>The subject of Canto XX is avarice, for Dante the most detestable of vices. Avarice—in this case the collective avarice of the kings of France, who in the poet’s lifetime thwarted the election of an emperor and effectively subjugated the papacy—destroys the ordered fabric of life, and the canto is notable for an impassioned speech delivered by a shade, Hugh Capet, who is a mouthpiece for the poet’s anti-gallicism. Canto XX is virtually devoid of lyricism, as befits the gravity of the vice, and it can be seen to fall into three parts, with a sustained central speech</p>

                     <p>Canto XXI is in many ways a canto of thresholds and surprises or, as William Stephany has emphasized, of conversions. These threshold crossings involve both poetic and religious issues, nor can the two ever be far apart for Dante. The canto, which introduces a major classical poet and discusses the influence of Virgil’s poetry, is also the first in which we meet a soul fully cleansed of sin and ready to ascend to Paradise. Beginning with the appearance of Statius and ending with his recognition of Virgil, this canto offers the last concentration on classical poetry before the series of</p>

The gluttons run around this cornice and purge themselves of their sin by suffering the pangs of hunger and thirst, made sharper by the sight of fruit and water.

In fact, Sansone has added that the pauselike quality or narrative suspension following the poignant voice of Arnaut Daniel in the refining fire and foreshadowing the apparition of Matilda in the place of perennial springtime is counterpointed by an “ascending</p>

                     <p>Certified fit to travel alone by Virgil at the close of Canto XXVII, Dante strolls eagerly into the Garden of Eden. This shady forest atop Mount Purgatory is the setting for his meeting with a stunningly beautiful maiden who appears all alone, laughing and singing, on the other side of a two-pronged rivulet. As she gathers flowers to weave a garland, she reminds him of Persephone; her glance recalls Venus, luminescent with love for Adonis. Dante, longing to step across the narrow stream, compares himself to Leander grounded on the shore of the Hellespont by storm-swollen breakers, just where once</p>

                     <p>To the modern reader this canto might seem at first to be of a somewhat remote and antiquarian interest with, at best, a certain formal and old-fashioned poetic beauty. Coming immediately after the richly textured account of humankind’s lost paradise on earth and of the beautiful lady who explains it to Dante, Canto XXIX introduces a series of symbols from which the reader is required to deduce a corresponding series of “other meanings.” It would appear, therefore, to belong to that outmoded form, the allegory, and indeed virtually all commentators agree that it is an allegorical presentation of the history</p>

                     <p>Canto XXX is commonly regarded as the structural and emotional center of the<italic>Comedy,</italic>its kernel or nucleus. Preceded by sixty-three and followed by thirty-six cantos, it even has a symbolic centrality in the poem’s trinitarian numerology. Here Dante is at last reunited with Beatrice after his “ten-year thirst” (<italic>Purg.</italic>XXXII , 2–3) in a sequence that also unites the<italic>Comedy</italic>with the Vita Nuova, Dante’s present with his poetic past. His guide up till this moment, Virgil, disappears from the poem in between the very lines in which Beatrice is presented. The style of the canto is deliberately</p>

                     <p>However much Canto XXXI forms a solid continuation of the one preceding it, only here does Dante render a full account of himself, even if his confession is directed at Beatrice, who draws it out after she turns directly toward him. It has been preceded by her condemnation of his past behavior that she mediates by addressing the angels around her chariot, as Dante listens from across the stream of Lethe (XXX, 103), and by her ironic, sarcastic comments (XXX, 55–57 and 73–75), with which she nonetheless implicates herself.</p>

                     <p>Canto XXXII depends heavily on the effect of its incipit, an opening verse that almost seamlessly links this canto to the preceding one in which Beatrice makes her dramatic appearance, on a much more profound level, to the experience of world and Church history in Dante’s own keenly developed sense of political and moral poetics.</p>
                     <p>On the poetic stage of the six cantos that conclude the<italic>Purgatorio</italic>(XXVIII–XXXIII), the double spectacle of world order and Dante’s personalpoetic drama unfolds in the symbolic state of innocence unique to Earthly Paradise.

                     <p>Closely connected with the allegorical scene described at the end of Canto XXXII, and consequently, also with Cantos XXX–XXXI , Canto XXXIII begins with the seven ladies’ sad proclamation of the chariot’s destruction (1–6). It then continues with Beatrice’s prediction of an ultimate redemption (7–102) and concludes with Dante the Pilgrim’s total transformation and renewal through the waters of the second Edenic river, Eunoe (103–145). Furthermore, in the last part of Canto XXXIII, Beatrice first instructs the lady whom Dante the Pilgrim encountered on entering the Earthly Paradise to complete the role assigned to her and</p>
