         <p>This collection brings together a number of leading scholars in film studies to explore viewing and listening dispositives-the Foucauldian concept of a strategic and technical configuration of practices and discourses-from the emergence of film studies as a field in the 1960s to more recent uses of the concept. In particular, the contributors confront points of view and perspectives in the context of the rise and spread of new technologies-changes that are continually altering the boundaries and the spaces of cinema and thus demand new analysis and theoretization.</p>

In French, the term “dispositif” refers to a plurality of meanings, from the simple mechanism of a device, instrument or machine, to the epistemological construction liable to produce effects of power and knowledge – the disciplinary<italic>dispositif</italic>or the<italic>dispositif</italic>of sexuality.

While changes in basic technology, public perception and artistic practice in sound and image media may often evolve over long historical cycles, our main working assumption is that there are also</p>

                     <p>“Cinema is the moving image”: the idea, which has become a commonplace, coalesced around 1900 as photography was being referred to as the still image. The opposition between photography and cinema made it possible throughout the twentieth century, and to this day, to assign distinct tasks in the representation of reality to each of these emblematic dispositives of modernity. Still, the association still/moving also structured the cinematographic dispositive as such as early as the late nineteenth century. Indeed, photography was not the other of cinema at the time, but a means used by “cinema” in its chronophotographic stage to reconstitute</p>

                     <p>We know how Gilles Deleuze turned the commonplace inside out: Bergson, so it went, had “missed” cinema, contenting himself with a critique of its dispositive – the mechanism of the projecting device called the “cinematograph,” to be specific. Before the critique of the “cinematographic illusion,” developed for the most part in 1907 in<italic>Creative Evolution</italic>,¹ there was indeed the doctrine of real movement, whose touchstone was the pure perception of movement as an act or progression rather than as a relation distributed in the spatial order. Movement unfolds in time, not in space. This bold thesis, exposed in<italic>Matter and Memory</italic>,</p>

                     <p>Today, many academics working in the Humanities and Social Sciences are pursuing a broad interest in media studies. At least at Yale University, where we have created an interdisciplinary seminar in this area, what we mean by media studies – our actual focuses and concerns – differ substantially. In the English Department, for instance, Media Studies foregrounds the study of the book and the move from the scroll or codex. In the more contemporary context, Michael Warner and Jessica Pressman are clearly interested in the way the digital media and the Internet are impacting the book and print culture more generally.

                     <p>At the conference at which this paper was presented, two participants made a reference to Guillaume Apollinaire without consulting each other beforehand. François Albera first pointed out that, according to the author of “The New Spirit and the Poets,” poets wanted to be able some day “to mechanize poetry as the world has been mechanized.”³ For my part, I projected an excerpt of the poem used here as an epigraph and straightforwardly titled “Before the Cinema.” No intention or planning, no machination should be read into this coincidence, which is first and foremost the result of chance. Still, the coincidence</p>

                     <p>If the “dispositif” constitutes a “moment,” it is not so much in accordance with its theoretical unity as with its scattered persistence in film theory. This persistence of the word necessarily brings up the question of its provenance: of which theoretical formation is this notion the standard? The word appeared in the 1970s at the intersection of key concepts – the unconscious, ideology, the signifier – which found the topological model of their functioning in cinematographic technique. Through the primacy given to arrangements, the notion of the “dispositif” fostered a spatial distribution of concepts: the topology of the “scenographic cube” revealed by</p>

                     <p>Like the idea of structure, the notion of the “dispositif” does not pertain to a single level of analysis: it applies to specific objects, such as the mechanism of a watch, but also to large ensembles, as in Foucault’s work, where it came to substitute for the episteme in the late 1970s. By contrast to the episteme, focused too narrowly on the utterances produced by a society, Foucault’s<italic>dispositif</italic>refers more widely to the totality of discourses, social practices, technical inventions, architectural creations instituting, at a given time, the partition between the true and the false in the domain of</p>

The phenomenal craze created by this original stage spectacle ended up imposing it as one of the motifs characterizing artistic expression at the turn of the twentieth century. Countless variations have attested to this, at least until the First World War, in areas as diverse as sculpture, painting, architecture, furniture,</p>

In 1948, Jack Gould mentioned the fact that television found inspiration in preexisting arts to argue that, precisely because it combined “[…] the close-up of the motion picture, the spontaneity of the living stage and the instantaneousness of radio” and was “the fusion of these three elements,” it was absolutely unique.² Reviewing the 1949 season, Flora R.

Still, a simple look at the phenomenon already reveals a variety of objects.

                     <p>In a farcical piece titled “The Maldoror-Poems Dispositive,” Francis Ponge mockingly invites us to draw a use value from Lautréamont:</p>
                     <p>Open Lautréamont! And there you have literature turned inside out like an umbrella!</p>
                     <p>Close Lautréamont! And everything immediately falls back into place…</p>
                     <p>To enjoy complete intellectual comfort at home, try and adapt the MAL-DOROR/POEMS dispositive to your library.¹</p>
                     <p>This 1946 text implicitly refers to the famous umbrella of<italic>The Songs of Maldoror</italic>, which reads: “as beautiful as the random encounter between an umbrella and a sewing machine upon a dissecting table.”² Yet Ponge, dismissing the fantastic element, extracts a domestic</p>

                     <p>To examine the notion of the<italic>dispositive</italic>and identify its place in contemporary practices at the intersection of two institutions, Cinema and the Museum, this text proposes a progression through a few individual cases, with the outlines of a study.

The call underlined how the study of a series of isolated cases would risk “perpetuating the ambiguity of encounters in which epistemological questioning</p>
