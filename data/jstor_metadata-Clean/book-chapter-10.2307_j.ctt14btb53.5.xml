         <p>
            <italic>The Strange Music of Social Life</italic>presents a dialogue on dialogic sociology, explored through the medium of music. Sociologist and composer Michael Mayerfeld Bell presents an argument that both sociology and classical music remain largely in the grip of a nineteenth-century totalizing ambition of prediction and control. He provides the refreshing approach of "strangency" to explain a sociology that tries to understand not only the regularities of social life but also the social conditions in which people do what we do not expect.</p>
         <p>Nine important sociologists and musicians respond-often vigorously-to the conversation Bell initiates by raising pivotal questions.<italic>The Strange Music of Social Life</italic>concludes with Bell's reply to those responses and offers new insight into sociology and music sociology.</p>

                     <p>In his essay “Strange Music: Notes toward a Dialogic Sociology,” Michael Bell (this volume) echoes a concern about the epistemological foundation of sociology that has been developing over the past few years. Along the lines of Andrew Abbott’s (2007) call for a “lyrical sociology,” Bell proposes a sociology with two attributes: (1) an appreciation of the dimension of social life that is unpredictable and (in his view) therefore unexplainable and (2) an eradication of the detachment between researcher and object of study. Critical of the discipline’s penchant for “total explanation,” Bell suggests a sociology that views its task less as</p>

                     <p>Michael Bell proposes that modern composition, like modern sociological theory, has low tolerance for being surprised. He argues that making a space for such contrary action—strangency—is related to a more dialogic conception of music and theory. Although his critiques of composition and theory seem justified, it is far from clear (1) that the “actor” in theory is analogous to the “performer” in music or that the theorist is thus parallel to a composer, (2) that allowing performers more freedom in playing does what Bell seems to want, and (3) that sociology can do much with an attention to</p>

                     <p>I may have skipped a beat somewhere, but the idea that sociology aims for explanation seems old-fashioned to me. My sociology aims for revolution. We live in a small and shrinking world with an out-of-control CIA, Pentagon, and president; a reactionary Supreme Court; and greedy CEOs; and we live in a world that faces looming environmental crises. America has the highest rate of incarceration the entire world, ranks at the bottom of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries on its rate infant mortality, and has the highest Gini coefficient on income inequality. We torture prisoners in violation</p>

                     <p>I had never heard of classical music’s first principle until I read Michael Bell’s paper (that principle is “Do what you are told”). In fact, as a violinist, what immediately popped into my head as a “first principle” was “Play in tune!” This is exactly what I was told the first time I ever played for the pedagogue Dorothy DeLay (to be more accurate, I was told, “Sugarplum, you need to work on your intonation”). So I started to ask musicians I know—some known, some working on becoming so, and some just working—“What is the first principle of</p>

                     <p>Michael Bell’s proposal for a “dialogic sociology” (this volume) is a response to what he perceives to be an obsession in the discipline with “total explanation,” which means that the sociological researcher attempts to develop a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon using a conceptual apparatus that emphasizes causality, predictability, objectivity, and neutrality. He argues that sociologists are so preoccupied with discovering whether their preconceptions about social life are correct that they do not attempt to understand the social conditions in which people behave in ways that sociologists do not expect.</p>

                     <p>I started playing the trumpet almost fi fteen years ago. Eleven of those years were spent studying classical music and the appropriate techniques of the style. I learned how to play by studying with band directors in school bands and with private instructors. I was taught to read music, to blend in with other musicians in an ensemble, and to take direction from a conductor. In other words, I am a classically trained musician. This training always included a focus on instruction and on learning the correct way to play. As Michael Bell points out, “the first principle of classical</p>
