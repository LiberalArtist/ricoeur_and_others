      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>This groundbreaking anthology is the first to navigate the interconnections between the rhetorics and aesthetics of the Pacific. Like the bright and multifaceted constellation for which it is named, Huihui: Rhetorics and Aesthetics in the Pacific showcases a variety of genres and cross-genre forms—critical essays, poetry, short fiction, speeches, photography, and personal reflections—that explore a wide range of subjects, from Disney’s Aulani Resort to the Bishop Museum, from tiki souvenirs to the Dusky Maiden stereotype, from military recruitment to colonial silencing, from healing lands to healing words and music, from decolonization to sovereignty. These works go beyond conceiving of Pacific rhetorics and aesthetics as being always and only in response to a colonizing West and/or East. Instead, the authors emphasize the importance of situating their work within indigenous intellectual, political, and cultural traditions and innovations of the Pacific. Taken together, this anthology threads ancestral and contemporary discursive strategies, questions colonial and oppressive representations, and seeks to articulate an empowering decolonized future for all of Oceania. Representing several island and continental nations, the contributing authors include Albert Wendt, Haunani-Kay Trask, Mililani Trask, Chantal Spitz, Jonathan Kay Kamakawiwoʻole Osorio, Flora Devatine, Kalena Silva, Steven Winduo, Alice Te Punga Somerville, Selina Tusitala Marsh, kuʻualoha hoʻomanawanui, Craig Santos Perez, Gregory Clark, Chelle Pahinui, Dan Taulapapa McMullin, Michael Puleloa, Lisa King, and Steven Gin. Collectively, their words guide us over ocean routes like the great waʻa, vaʻa, waka, proa, and sakman once navigated by the ancestors of Oceania, now navigated again by their descendants.</p>

                     <p>The metaphorical in language is now a starting place for any of us who wish to write. When one wishes to write about the Pacific, the challenge may be to acknowledge some of the old metaphors—and then to add a new one, or more, for the sake of understanding and further work. When we think of the Pacific we can think in diagrammatic terms, for example, of circles, circles within circles, webs of open space; we can think of more pictorial metaphors, like far-reaching ropes, nets of enormous size, waves or nested ripples of ocean water; we can think</p>

                     <p>Linguists estimate that there are more than six thousand languages spoken in the world today and, alarmingly, that 60 percent are at risk of extinction with the passing of their last speakers (Hinton 2001; Nettle and Romaine 2000). Of the estimated 300 North American indigenous languages spoken when the explorer Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492, some 210 survive; of the 210, about 175 are in the United States (Krauss 1996). Young, fluent speakers of a language are key to its continuing vitality among future generations. Of the 175 surviving indigenous languages in the United States, only about 20 have speakers</p>

In indigenous literature, the urban-based civilized girl often serves as a trope for the ills of Westernization and colonization. She is implicitly contrasted with the traditional girl, who is based in the village and whose adherence to static traditional roles remains unquestioned</p>

                     <p>Perhaps one of the most well-known poems by a Māori writer is Apirana Taylor’s “Sad Joke on a Marae” (1979, 15). In the poem, a man named Tu stands and addresses his ancestors, who are “carved on the meeting house wall.” Since its publication in Taylor’s 1979 collection<italic>Eyes of the Ruru</italic>, “Sad Joke” has circulated variously as an articulation of cultural loss, cultural continuity, cultural resilience, and cultural change. While Tu is most often read as a Māori man who has spent too long in non-Māori space, he is also a Māori man going through the normal relational process</p>

                     <p>The long relationship between Euro-American museums and Indigenous peoples bears a legacy of problems and abuses, as museums have interpreted Indigenous peoples’ histories and cultures through an exclusively Euro-American worldview. The Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum of Honolulu is no exception. It is this chapter’s purpose to explore the ways in which the Bishop Museum has recognized this colonial rhetorical framework through which it has maintained and displayed its collections. In particular, the chapter analyzes how the 2006–2009 renovation of the Hawaiian Hall facilities at the Bishop Museum was an active, if ultimately ambiguous, attempt to decolonize the rhetorical habits</p>

Even though the mouse is a more “recent introduction” to Hawai‘i, probably from California (Bryan 1915, 293), it is likely that these ‘ōlelo no‘eau refer inclusively to the rat and mouse, as in ‘ōlelo Hawai‘i, ‘iole may be translated as either. While the rat and the mouse are both common pets, in Hawai‘i both are also invasive species that potentially transmit diseases, contaminate food, and destroy property. Thus, the caution conveyed by</p>

                     <p>My family migrated from Guåhan (Guam) to California in 1995, when I was a sophomore in high school. One of the reasons my parents decided to move was so that I could be better prepared to succeed in a “mainland” university. While I was excited about continuing my education, I had no idea how my family could afford college. After expressing this concern to my new high school counselor, he suggested I attend the Army recruiter’s presentation during the time when college recruiters visited our campus.</p>

I opened with a mele inoa, a song that I had composed the week before for the infant daughter of a close friend who is himself a musician and descendant of some of the most respected and important Hawaiian composers of the last century. I had several reasons for singing that song for the lecture. In par tic u lar, I wanted to stress the importance of relying on our own language for commemorating</p>

                     <p>Rhetoric works to resolve conflict by forging agreement. Aesthetic works to provide diverse people with a common experience. Both, whether directly or by considerable indirection, help people who find they must share a space move from contention to community. They do that by communicating identity—a sense of self and affiliation for those who are addressed to adopt for themselves. So we might phrase it this way: rhetoric forges the kind of agreement we understand in conceptual terms, while aesthetic offers an opportunity to experience that agreement by inhabiting with others at least for a moment a common identity.

Meiwi mo‘okalaleo, or Kanaka Maoli oral, literary, and rhetorical devices, form the foundation of Kanaka Maoli aesthetics, or what is considered beautiful, pleasing, and desirable in the performance or reading of mo‘olelo (story, history). The skillful use of meiwi both creates and enhances the ‘ono (flavor) of Hawaiian verbal and literary arts. Thus, the reference to pa‘akai (sea salt), a mainstay cultural</p>
