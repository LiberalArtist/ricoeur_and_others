      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.</p>

The conference’s main purposes were to examine the first two chapters of Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians, (aspects of) the reception of these chapters in the history of theology, and, in a constructive approach, their potential meaning today. The fact that two systematic theologians (the co-editors of this book) and a historian of early Christianity</p>

                     <p>The title of this volume—<italic>The Wisdom and the Foolishness of God</italic>—is drawn from the paradoxical maxim that Paul enunciates in 1 Cor. 1:25: “for the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (translations from the New Testament my own). Paul’s arresting expression borders on blasphemy: to speak of the foolishness and the weakness of God is to contradict standard assumptions about the divine, assumptions necessary to maintain God’s status as God. The way Paul’s maxim has reverberated down the centuries, spawning one form of radical theology after</p>

Everything is demanded of theology, up to and including the most austere renunciation, the most shocking deprivation of its privileges, of its regal aspirations as the queen of the sciences, of its own special knowledge, revelations, and inspirations, requiring it to be poor and itinerant, naked and obedient, even unto death.

                     <p>Late-modern questions and concerns lead Paul’s readers to suppose that Paul’s opposition of “wisdom” to “folly” is the lens for focusing Paul’s meaning.¹ Just so, the best reading of Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is the reading that best interprets that opposition’s dissonance as the center of Paul’s thought.² It is not as though Paul does not oppose cruciform folly to worldly wisdom. Any exegete must acknowledge Paul’s playful polarities of wisdom and folly, power and weakness, and so on. But it is not a foregone conclusion that this opposition forms the core of Paul’s theology in 1 Corinthians</p>

                     <p>Wisdom and foolishness intertwined—the theology of the cross—and consequently speeches in the form of<italic>theologica paradoxa</italic>, of paradoxical theology: these are all widely known as characteristics of Reformation theology, especially of the Lutheran style. Indeed, it was Luther who furnished this connection and put it under the rubric of<italic>theologica paradoxa</italic>. But why look for<italic>theologica paradoxa</italic>in Erasmus and Cusanus if this rubric is distinctive to Luther? Despite the somewhat strange juxtaposition of these two authors with Luther, it is likely that neither of them would have put their work under a Lutheran heading. Therefore, this discussion</p>

The link between the cross of Christ and the power of God is thus explicitly made by Paul. Consequently, one must ask whether it is possible, in a Christian theological perspective, to think about something we may call God’s “almightiness” from the event of the cross and, first, from the “word of the cross” around which the second</p>

In this christological model the goal of creation is a love relationship with human beings, and in this relationship God comes as close to God’s creatures as God can—in becoming human.
