         <p>What is the future of Continental philosophy of religion? These forward-looking essays address the new thinkers and movements that have gained prominence since the generation of Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and Levinas and how they will reshape Continental philosophy of religion in the years to come. They look at the ways concepts such as liberation, sovereignty, and post-colonialism have engaged this new generation with political theology and the new pathways of thought that have opened in the wake of speculative realism and recent findings in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology. Readers will discover new directions in this challenging and important area of philosophical inquiry.</p>

                     <p>The future has always figured prominently in Continental philosophy of religion. Indeed, we might even say that the (relatively short) history of Continental philosophy of religion has been defined by the future. So by way of introduction, our task will be to chart the concept of the future that has animated, inspired, and propelled this burgeoning discourse, which, by our reckoning, has both come into its own and reached a turning point, if not a terminal point or a fork in the road. Put otherwise, by posing the question of the future of Continental philosophy of religion, we are posing</p>

                     <p>Jacques Derrida is dead. Now they are all dead—all the<italic>soixant-huitaires.</italic>¹ So, is it over? Is Continental philosophy—and by extension, Continental philosophy of religion—as we know it dead? For a younger generation of philosophers, the so-called theological turn is the last straw. If the religious turn is where Continental philosophy ends up, supplying a final place for religion to hide before the “singularity” arrives,² then Continental philosophy is dead. If it is not, the first order of business is to kill it off. What good is Nietzsche’s death of God, if we still have to deal with</p>

Caputo and Merold Westphal—a binary that,<italic>pace</italic>negative prejudices toward metaphysical polarities, simply sounds appropriate, a dynamic duo that one truly feels no duress to displace.¹ Personally, I cannot refrain from comparing this pair to other distinctive dyads who have achieved fame in Western history and literature. Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus, Augustine and Pelagius, Bernard and Abelard, Pope Leo X and Luther, Batman and the Joker, Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort all come to mind whenever I contemplate the deep respect and affection that Caputo and Westphal have for each other.

                     <p>We know our futures from our adopted pasts. The Ur-text for Continental philosophy of religion is penned by the elusive Johannes de Silentio, sometime freelancer in the employ of Søren Kierkegaard, in 1843 in the Danish market town, Copenhagen. Surprisingly, the first really<italic>intelligible</italic>figure of faith in<italic>Fear and Trembling</italic>is not the grotesque, or shall we say, monstrous father who binds Isaac at God’s command, but an unassuming mother weaning her child. De Silentio announces that his approach will employ resources both “dialectical” and “lyrical,” both philosophical and poetic. In the event, however, even these rival measures do</p>

A voice spoke from behind him. “I assume you remember our previous conversation here?” Abraham shuddered. “Oh. It’s you,” he said. “I might have known. I do remember now. I remember that I haggled with you for the lives of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. You said that you would spare them if there were fifty righteous among them. I bargained you down to ten. Not that it stopped you.”</p>

Caputo and Slavoj Žižek suspect that matter is not what ultimately matters for John Milbank.¹ Within what Caputo calls “the soft Gnosticism” of “strong” theologies such as Radical Orthodoxy, the spirit is<italic>in</italic>the flesh<italic>but not of</italic>the flesh. Desiring to escape materiality and reach union with God, Milbank’s is a theology of<italic>in</italic>-carnation rather than of<italic>carnality,</italic>and Caputo identifies this tendency in Milbank’s materialism, which operates within an economy of</p>

Thus liberation would be conceived as liberation from oppression, injustice, ignorance, and illusion.

                     <p>Claims about the future involve perceptions of the present and discourses about the past. This is especially so in the case of money. As a peculiar social technology that indexes value and regulates relations of credit and debt, it reflects and shapes expectations and, hence, projects a future. In consideration of the course this monetary future might take in the West, theology and the philosophy of religion are necessary resources with which to engage. As genealogies of modernity and capitalism have laid bare, theological and religiously inflected philosophical discourses have been determinative for the Western sociopolitical imaginary.¹ Money has likewise</p>

As Camus travelled to Stockholm to receive the award, the editor of<italic>Le Monde,</italic>Hubert Beuve-Méry, said that he was convinced that Camus would say something stupid, and, in his own mind, he was proved right.¹ Having received the Nobel Prize, Camus said, “I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before I will defend justice,” subsequently converted by the press into “between justice and my mother, I choose my mother.”² The statement became notorious and gave rise to much puzzlement, debate, and hostility.

Scholars who work on or within Asian philosophical traditions find themselves facing much the same predicament as those who locate themselves somewhere within the vaguely post-phenomenological landscape called “Continental philosophy of religion.” To what disciplinary genus does this species of scholarship—which has also become a recognizable<italic>style</italic>of scholarship—belong? To philosophy? To religious studies? To theology? Perhaps to none of these options? In what follows, I would like to think about</p>

Contemporary phenomenology of religion exalts in the absolute, the excessive, the radical, and the extreme. The experiences it depicts always balance on the very edge of the abyss, on the very line of liminality, on the razor blade of the most extreme paradox.</p>

One could focus on established or more recently introduced authorial paradigms—for instance and to name but a few, Derrida, Deleuze, Caputo, Malabou, Goodchild, Westphal, Laruelle, and so on—and assess their legacy, debate their future, or perhaps even establish a vanguard. But in the vanguard or not, these contemporary thinkers and their followers attest to the recent so-called return to religion of Continental phenomenological thought. Cast in this way, the volume’s theme could suggest not merely that faith and religious thought have</p>

In suggesting such a title, a beautiful one indeed, Caputo has made clear that, for him, my intellectual journey—starting with Hegel, going on with Heidegger, and then turning, in a move that might have appeared as a rupture, toward neurology and neuroplasticity—was not an estrangement from deconstruction but on the contrary a way of bringing it forward in trying to adapt it to the political as well as scientific and philosophical realities of the twenty-first century.

                     <p>I do not begin from the premise that religion, as a set of beliefs, thoughts, or symbols, is an independently individuated entity of its own. By this I mean that religion is individuated as a phenomenon through human behavior and thought. This is intended to imply that the study of religions must think about religions as arising through, or possibly existing in, human behaviors. In this sense, religion does not exist independently of a human subject with causal or agentive powers in the world. Seeing religion as something in-itself fails to capture this aspect of it and consequently fails to</p>

                     <p>In this essay I want to explore Schelling’s cosmological philosophy by comparing it to early Indian philosophy on one hand and the philosophy of Luce Irigaray on the other hand. In the first section I begin with a comparison of Schelling’s cosmogonical question from<italic>Ages of the World</italic>and the Indian Vedic cosmogonic hymn “Nasadasiya.” The basic question of this section on the “philosophy of beginning” is whence comes the creation of the world. There is no direct textual evidence in Schelling’s writings that he read this particular Vedic hymn, but there are striking similarities between Schelling’s cosmogonical concepts and</p>

                     <p>In seeking to outline a future of Continental philosophy of religion, as is the objective of this volume, perhaps we first need to trace the trajectory of the future of Continental philosophy itself. It could be said that the latter endeavor had already been put in place by Jean-Luc Nancy sometime in 1986, when he posed the question of<italic>qui vient après le sujet,</italic>or “who comes after the subject,” a question coming in the wake of the dissolution, or the putting to death, of the<italic>subject</italic>by Continental philosophy since the late 1960s. What Nancy’s question implies is that</p>
