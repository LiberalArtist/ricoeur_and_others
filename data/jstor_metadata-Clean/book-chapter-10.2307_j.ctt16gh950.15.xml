         <p>This timely book examines the power and role of the image in modern Middle Eastern societies. The essays explore the role and function of image making to highlight the ways in which the images "speak" and what visual languages mean for the construction of Islamic subjectivities, the distribution of power, and the formation of identity and belonging. Visual Culture in the Modern Middle East addresses aspects of the visual in the Islamic world, including the presentation of Islam on television; on the internet and other digital media; in banners, posters, murals, and graffiti; and in the satirical press, cartoons, and children's books.</p>

                     <p>From television and computer screens to billboards and magazines, images speak to modern human beings, shaping our social imaginaries and our visual cultures.¹ The term “visual culture” describes the mechanisms that produce and recycle visual material in various public cultures. Moreover, since the late 1980s it has come to designate a new interdisciplinary field of study, departing from the traditional methods of art historical inquiry to incorporate theoretical insights from literature, anthropology, sociology, cultural theory, gender studies, film, and media studies in order to examine a wider range of visual materials. Largely a disciplinary offshoot of cultural studies, which gained</p>

                     <p>A colorful mural appeared at the busy junction between Modarres Highway and Motahhari Street in central Tehran in 2008, gracing the wall of an otherwise unremarkable five-story cement building (fig. 1.1 and plate 1). This mural does not depict what one would expect to see in Iran’s post-revolutionary mural arts program: Ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamenei or the portrait of a martyr who died in the Iran–Iraq War (1980–88). These other mural subjects, which have graced and given meaning to the capital city’s urban landscape over the past thirty years, represent a genre of public portraiture that stresses both</p>

                     <p>The extensive use of propagandist imagery by the Islamic Republic and the subsequent scholarly attention paid to this phenomenon has somehow eclipsed the use of visual imagery published by religious scholars and activists prior to Iran’s 1979 Revolution. Of the hundreds of publications disseminated by religious groups before the revolution,<italic>Nabard-i Millat</italic>—the widely distributed weekly newspaper of the religious fundamentalist organization Fadaian Islam published in the first half of the 1950s—is particularly striking.

                     <p>Since the Middle Ages, Saladin has been one of the most influential figures of historical memory in Eurasia. He was used as a symbol of the noble enemy, of war with the West and Israel, and of peace.¹ In various incarnations he was also a national hero. During the Lebanon War of 2006, even Nasrallah, the Shi‘i leader of the Hizbullah in Lebanon, was eulogized by Syrians as the “Saladin of the modern age.”² Moreover, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the Sunni<italic>Kata’ib Salah al-Din</italic>in Iraq chose Saladin as the eponym for their guerrilla war against the Shi‘i</p>

The Rotana channels began to run advertisements for the new cinema channel featuring one of the company’s most famous and controversial music video stars, the voluptuous Lebanese pop singer Hayfa Wahbi.

                     <p>A group of paintings known as Crying Boys—attributed to Italian painter Bruno Amadio (1911–81), also known as Bragolin—gained widespread popularity in many parts of the world in the 1980s. Portraying the tearful faces of children, these works have inspired various popular cultural practices, including the establishment of fan clubs and the telling of urban legends devoted to the subjects’ “curse.”¹ In the 1970s and 1980s one of these paintings became especially popular in Turkey (fig. 5.1 and plate 11). Initially, Crying Boy was in vogue in the private realm, displayed in many working- and middle-class homes—reproductions</p>

                     <p>As elsewhere, Islamism in Turkey has been a political and cultural project that challenges the dominant dichotomies of traditional/modern, public/private, and Islamic/non-Islamic.¹ Studies of the cultural transformation and the emergence of new subjectivities brought by Islamism demonstrate the high significance of “visibility” to the Islamist project,² which has altered the public sphere to emphasize the “Islamic” difference—often through dress codes for women. According to Nilüfer Göle, since 1990 Islamism has experienced a second phase, in which its cultural program has become more apparent. The movement’s first phase was characterized by militant and revolutionary politics. In this second phase of</p>

                     <p>Since the 2003 Iraq War, religious figures in Iraq have employed various forms of visual media, from satellite television to the internet, to reach followers in national and transnational settings. The visual narrative of Muqtada al-Sadr in post–2003 Iraq provides a vibrant case study of the relationship between Islamist political elites (clerical politicians and lay figures) and their strategies for political communication in the Arab world. After 2003 the Sadrists emerged in post–Ba’athist Iraq as a religious elite that sought to protect the interests of the Shi’a masses, particularly their urban poor in Baghdad, and engaged in a religious</p>

The new mural replaces an old, fading image whose background depicted a blue sky poetically strewn with drifting clouds, framed on two sides by lines of poetry executed as an aesthetically appealing exercise in traditional calligraphy. The older mural’s primary subject was a realistic portrait, set off against the background in a separate frame, of a man whose name</p>

                     <p>Two iconic images used in Turkish political debates, the light bulb and the headscarf, can be read as representing political opposites: thought and enlightenment versus fanaticism and obscurantism. But what does it represent when the two are joined in an image, as in a depiction in which the light bulb, the symbol of the ruling Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Parti, or AKP), wears a headscarf (fig. 10.1)?¹ Is this the smothering of critical, enlightened thought by fanatics determined to impose rigid religious dogma, or is this the liberation of the human mind from the rigid secularist dogma</p>

Their key product, the dramatic miniseries (<italic>musalsal</italic>) dominates public culture in the Arab world. This is particularly true during Ramadan, which has given the genre its form and has in turn been shaped by it. In the months leading up to this peak broadcast season, the city of Damascus becomes a film set, as producers rush to finish their thirty-episode series.
