      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Jean Godefroy Bidima's La Palabre examines the traditional African institution of palaver as a way to create dialogue and open exchange in an effort to resolve conflict and promote democracy. In the wake of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and the gacaca courts in Rwanda, Bidima offers a compelling model of how to develop an African public space where dialogue can combat misunderstanding. This volume, which includes other essays on legal processes, cultural diversity, memory, and the internet in Africa, offers English-speaking readers the opportunity to become acquainted with a highly original and important postcolonial thinker.</p>

When, a decade later, on the cover of its 3 December issue, the same magazine saluted a “Rising Africa,” those seeds had started to produce palpable results. Among the reasons that led the continent from “hopeless” to “rising” were peace and democratization, which brought about political stability and rule of law. Of</p>

                     <p>What is this elementary but problematic social bond, “living-together”? How can it give authority to the law so that people find courts and legislatures trustworthy—even when their personal interests may be threatened—if not, as Burke warned, through tradition? When living-together becomes an elementary<italic>problem</italic>, we have to ask how we could ever have expected tradition to maintain our social world in the first place. We also ask how<italic>criticism</italic>of beliefs, including the belief in tradition, could turn out to be a way of preserving or renewing collective life [<italic>vivre-ensemble</italic>].</p>

                     <p>The primary competitor to<italic>palabre</italic>is found in traditional societies’ existing forms of domination.

                     <p>Taking together place, time, and manner, it would be possible to describe “the encounter” as comprising at least six modes: fragility, temporality, activity, integrity, causality, and disparity.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether it is a collision or a harmonious synthesis, the encounter consists of a rather<italic>fragile</italic>balance, since two realities (cultures, or forms of rationality) in contact will never be arithmetically proportionate; asymmetry is a necessary part of the encounter with the other, as Emmanuel Lévinas would say. Hence that fragility, which is indeed the expression of the encounter as a place and moment of instability and thus reversibility.</p>

                     <p>Nonidentity has been perpetually stifled in Africa by discourses and practices of repression. Research is needed to show how the political dimension affects the concept of possibility in Critical Theory and in the confrontation between African modernity and its possibilities. Further, the epistemo-political importance of such an inquiry must be demonstrated. Finally, given the multiplicity of parameters that may be generated by every discourse on the political domain or political practice, we must identify the<italic>site</italic>from which our own interrogation of African political reality will emerge.</p>

The capital letter “L,” one element of the symbol for Larousse dictionaries and encyclopedias in france (L is also the first letter of the word “book” in romance languages), is there for a good reason: it “scatters in every direction.” L (either for “livre” or for “Larousse,” but let’s choose “livre”!) strews to the winds: Would the L therefore be “drunk” [<italic>ivre</italic>]? If so, it would seem that this drunkenness of the book were being censored by all these proclamations concerning the “end of the book”</p>
