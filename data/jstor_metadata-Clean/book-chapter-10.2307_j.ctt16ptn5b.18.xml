         <p>The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.</p>

                     <p>Catholic Christianity affirms that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, and that he became man and suffered for the redemption of the human race. It also proclaims that this Jesus who was crucified under Pontius Pilate is now alive. He has been raised from the dead and has been glorified in his human body, so as to die no more. These truths, so the Catholic church claims, are of objective significance for all human beings. An understanding of the ultimate meaning of human existence is possible only in light of the mystery of</p>

Behind this question there are a number of substantive issues. For example, what is does it mean to be modern? What constitutes “Thomism”? What is the relation between Thomistic thought and characteristically modern philosophy and theology? These are of course immense topics. Without pretending to ignore their importance, however, it is permissible to narrow the scope of our inquiry if we refocus the initial question posed here in a twofold way by asking: what are the particular</p>

What does it mean, from a Thomistic point of view, to hold that God the Word, the second person of the Trinity, became man and lived a true, human life in a historical place and time? To ask this question is to touch upon a significant theological topic: the ontology of the hypostatic union.

                     <p>The most contested affirmation regarding Jesus of Nazareth pertains to his divinity. It is the case, however, that the traditional affirmation of the perfect humanity of Jesus is also utterly controversial in modern theology. In one sense, this is simply because it is inherently controversial to affirm that there exists a real “essence” of human nature that God could assume. The subjacent question is philosophical: can we speak about perennial natures present in things in general and in human beings in particular down through time, and if so, how is it the case? In another sense, the controversial character of</p>

This notion alludes in an indirect but real way to the controversies surrounding the<italic>analogia entis</italic>, the famous twentieth-century debate between Karl Barth and Erich Przywara. Why? Because that controversy centered on the relationship between philosophical reason and theological science. Consider three acute questions at the heart of that debate.

In this chapter I would like to turn the argument around and suggest that the mystery of the incarnation invites us to uphold an analogical metaphysics of being. An ecumenical version of this argument was developed in mid-twentieth-century Catholic theology. A string of authors such as Erich Przywara, Gottlieb Söhngen, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Henri Bouillard emphasized the role that grace plays in the concrete historical formulation of all intellectual truths about</p>

The first four chapters of this book sought, then, to articulate an understanding of the mystery of the incarnation in traditional terms by appeal to the notions of the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, and the discussion of Jesus’s being and existence as the Word made flesh. I have purposefully contrasted this approach with the modern subject-oriented Christologies of Schleiermacher and Harnack. These latter sought to circumvent the formulas of the</p>

The modern kenotic tradition has focused upon the Paschal mystery as the primary locus of Trinitarian revelation.</p>

                     <p>Modern theology has focused upon the last words of Christ in Mark 15:34—“My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”—as a key locus of Christological dispute and interpretation.¹ Revisionist Enlightenment historians such as Reimarus have perceived in this verse an “authentic saying” of Jesus that predates the redaction of the Gospels. For him it is the indication of the Nazarene’s disillusioned apocalypticism.² Protestant theologians, meanwhile, have found warrant in this Scriptural text for a theology of Christ’s “god-forsakenness” experienced for us as a dimension of redemption. For Calvin it indicates Christ’s state of abandonment as an “experience</p>

                     <p>In the Prolegomenon to this book, I argued that modern Christology has been characterized by two important challenges: how should we respond to the Kantian critique of classical metaphysics? How might theologians employ modern historical-critical studies of the person of Jesus of Nazareth? Both topics impact the theology of the incarnation, but they affect the theology of the redemption as well. How should we understand the saving character of the death of Christ?</p>
                     <p>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a kenotic turn transpired in Christian theology that sought to respond to these two modern concerns, and which did so in</p>

                     <p>Is it an irony of modern theology that in the age in which Rudolph Bultmann should raise the question of the fundamentally mythological character of many New Testament ideas, Hans Urs von Balthasar should seek to reinvigorate the theological meaning of the descent of Christ into hell on Holy Saturday? Perhaps not. By offering a distinctive and in many ways innovative reading of this teaching of the Apostles’ Creed, Balthasar sought to challenge an age of overly reductive scientistic rationality, underscoring in Catholic theology the permanently valid interplay of literary symbolism, metaphysics, dramatic beauty, and Trinitarian mystery.

                     <p>Our study of the being of Christ would be incomplete without a consideration of his resurrection. What can we say about the glorification of his human nature that took place after his death? This depends in part upon what we take human nature to be. I have argued in the prolegomenon to this book that modern theology is often bifurcated. On the one side there is the tendency to reduce Christology to a form of idealized anthropology. Schleiermacher and Rahner provide models of this form of reflection. On the other side there is the theological assimilation of all natural forms</p>

                     <p>In the wake of the Second Vatican Council, Catholic theology embraced a primarily historical model of theological exploration. Topics such as Christology, the eucharist, and grace were treated by way of a chronological investigation: from the New Testament to the fathers, from the scholastic age to the early modern debates, terminating in a consideration of the<italic>status quaestionis</italic>of the subject within modern and contemporary theology. This approach represents the still standard model one encounters in virtually any theology textbook in our time. Chronology determines content.</p>
                     <p>Yet this is an inherently ambiguous approach, for at least two reasons. The first</p>
