      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.</p>

                     <p>By the sixteenth century’s end, London had arrived on stage. Not only was the commercial theater now a prominent fixture within the growing metropolis—the city’s “ornament,” Thomas Heywood would soon proclaim—but the metropolis itself was fast becoming a popular dramatic subject.¹ In<italic>Every Man Out of His Humor</italic>, Jonson prominently marks this convergence of city and stage when Cordatus steps forward at the start of Act 3 to enjoin spectators “to presuppose the stage the middle aisle in Paul’s” (3.1.2–3).² Performed at the recently opened Globe Theater in late 1599,<italic>Every Man Out</italic>is Jonson’s first experiment</p>

                     <p>Shakespeare’s<italic>Henry IV</italic>plays may seem an unlikely starting point for exploring theatrical mediations of urban experience. Announced by the king’s promise to unite his divided kingdom with a heroic crusade to Jerusalem, “[a]s far as to the sepulchre of Christ” (1.1.19), the plays’ geographic ambitions are global rather than local, in striking contrast to Shakespeare’s main dramatic source,<italic>The Famous Victories of Henry V</italic>, which opens with the Prince, “now about a mile off London” (1.13), making his way to “the old tavern in Eastcheap” (1.74).¹ Popularized by the Queen’s Men in the 1580s,<italic>The Famous Victories</italic>centers on</p>

The play celebrates More as an exemplary citizen, renowned not so much for his national prominence, or for his treason, but for setting “a gloss on London’s fame” (9.100).¹ More’s story is a London story, bounded by a local geography that extends from Cheapside and St. Martins Le Grand to the Guildhall and More’s residence in Chelsea.

                     <p>London city comedies catered to the moment and to an increasingly consumerist public—“fit for the times and the termers,” Thomas Middleton quipped to readers of<italic>The Roaring Girl</italic>(1611), slyly retailing his own as well as the city’s investments in the contemporary scene.¹ Famous for the notoriety of its title character,<italic>The Roaring Girl</italic>pushes these investments far beyond those of the other plays in this study. Not only do Middleton and Dekker track the close encounters of London’s population across a vividly drawn cityscape, but they take the novel step of impersonating a recognizable local figure on stage,</p>

                     <p>Ben Jonson’s note “To the Readers,” inserted into the 1631 edition of<italic>The Staple of News</italic>, marks a decided intensification of his preoccupation with the reception of his work. Even without this note, the play is overloaded with critical apparatus, including an onstage audience that holds forth after every act in a series of intermeans. Returning to the device inaugurated in his first play with a London setting, Jonson envisions theatrical performance in terms of debate and disagreement. But here, in place of the urbane moderators of<italic>Every Man Out of His Humor</italic>, he presents a quartet of outspoken gossips,</p>
