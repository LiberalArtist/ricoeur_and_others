      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>has been a controversial text since it was written in the thirteenth century. There is evidence for radically different readings as as early as the first half of the fourteenth century. The text provided inspiration for both courtly and didactic poets. Some read it as a celebration of human love; others as an erudite philosophical work; still others as a satirical representation of social and sexual follies. On one hand it was praised as an edifying treatise, on the other condemned as lascivious and misogynistic.</p>
         <p>Kevin Brownlee and Sylvia Huot and the contributors to this volume-Pierre-Yves Badel, Emmanuele Baumgartner, John V. Fleming, Robert Pogue Harrison, David F. Hult, Stephen G. Nichols, Lee Patterson, Daniel Poirion, Karl D. Uitti, Dieuwke E. van der Poel, and Lori Walters-represent all the major areas of current work on the<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>, both in American and in Europe. The volume will be of value to students and scholars of medieval literature, intellectual history, and art history.</p>

                     <p>The<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>is generally recognized as the single most significant work in the Old French literary tradition. Written between 1225 and 1275, the<italic>Rose</italic>’s success among medieval readers was extraordinary: well over two hundred manuscripts are extant, dating from a period of nearly three hundred years. Its influence was pervasive in late-medieval works both in and outside France. By the close of the fourteenth century, it had been translated into Italian, into Dutch, and into English. It was one of the only medieval vernacular texts to be cited and glossed in learnèd monastic treatises. Furthermore, its influence</p>

                     <p>In the three volumes of<italic>Time and Narrative</italic>, Paul Ricoeur has presented a philosophical summa, a comprehensive body of thought, that comes at an opportune moment to remind literary specialists of a long-recognized but still underexploited phenomenon: the essential link between narrative, historical or fictional, and time.¹ For Ricoeur has shown how narrative—in his words, that “guardian of time”—is the privileged medium by which the writer shapes, and the reader reshapes, “our confused, unformed, and at the limit mute temporal experience”;² and how it permits us to delimit more accurately, if perhaps not fully to master, the “mystery</p>

They merely recount how the Lover, having gazed into Narcissus’s “perilous fountain” in the Jardin de Déduit and been wounded by Cupid’s arrow, first sees and fixes upon what would be the object of his amorous passion, the rosebud. Yet, the undeniable indeterminacy with respect to the object of our lover-protagonist’s passion underscores a certain emptiness that appears to characterize this object, at least at this juncture in Guillaume’s poem. This is quite jarring; readers conventionally speak of the Lover’s obsession with<italic>a</italic>rose. In</p>

                     <p>Fascinated by the mirror in the “fountain of Narcissus,” critics compete in ingenious attempts to unveil its philosophical implications. The<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>has thus become a key text for the definition of unhappy self-consciousness. However, this medieval poem teaches us at the same time how to turn away from contemplating an empty consciousness in order to examine those things without which consciousness is nothing: the “malady” induced by analyzing subjectivity should be healed by a healthy dose of objectivity. That which Guillaume de Lorris’s text suggests, Jean de Meun’s demonstrates explicitly, by multiplying references to concrete objects within</p>

                     <p>My subject is Jean de Meun and the ancient poets—the great poets of Latin antiquity—and I approach this subject in what I take to be the spirit of this volume, a volume dedicated to<italic>re</italic>thinking the<italic>Roman de la Rose</italic>. There are many questions concerning the poem, including in my opinion a number of the most important ones, which are not yet ripe for<italic>re</italic>thinking for the simple reason that they have never been much thought about in the first place, but this is hardly true of the subject of what is usually called Jean de Meun’s “classicism.”</p>

                     <p>Virtually from the time of its composition in the late thirteenth century, Jean de Meun’s continuation of the<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>has been an object of controversy: its wit and its style have been celebrated; some of its more adventurous moral or social views have been condemned. The epistolary exchange in which Christine de Pizan participated was the first extended realization of such debates, but this exchange was itself preceded by evidence we can glean from literary works modeling themselves on the<italic>Rose</italic>allegory as well as from scribal manipulation of the text itself.¹ While the plethora of manuscripts</p>

                     <p>Ekphrasis no longer enjoys the name recognition it once did. In the terminology of classical rhetoric, ekphrasis “was the elaborate ‘delineation’ (έκΦρασις,<italic>descriptio</italic>, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

                     <p>MS 101 of the Municipal Library of Tournai is one of the most distinctive fourteenth-century manuscripts of the<italic>Roman de la Rose</italic>. Bearing the date of 1330, it is devoted to Gui de Mori’s rewriting of the allegorical romance¹ and includes emendations by an anonymous editor. The program of illumination presents variations on well-known iconography of the<italic>Rose</italic>besides introducing elements not found elsewhere.² In general, the illustrations refer directly to the text and follow the logical sequence of events in the work.

                     <p>The [<italic>Romance of the Rose</italic>] was no sooner written than it was rewritten; and the process of revision and<italic>remaniement</italic>continued throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.¹ The poem was abridged, expanded through the addition of interpolations, and altered through a combination of deletions and additions. A study of the manuscript tradition reveals that scribes sometimes worked from two or more sources at once; in this way the interpolations of a given remaniement found their way into the manuscript tradition, in some cases showing up in manuscripts of several different families. Scribes also introduced more modest changes in the text,</p>

                     <p>In the decade between 1395 and 1405, Christine de Pizan successfully established herself as a major figure in French literary history. This process necessarily involved a complex coming to terms with the dominant discursive practices of the late-medieval literary tradition: the creation of a new and distinctive voice within the context of this tradition. For Christine, this posed a special set of problems. It was not simply a question of attaining and demonstrating her formal mastery of various established literary genres. Her identity as a woman inevitably problematized her status as an “official” speaking subject in all of these generic</p>

Critics have noted the exceptionally great number of complete and fragmentary manuscripts that have come down to us, their profound influence on French and English literature, and the adaptations that were made in various languages: English, Italian, Dutch. These adaptations have not yet received the attention they deserve in international research. If the adaptations are considered as mere derivatives of the French text, one neglects the wealth of information they can provide about the reception of the<italic>Roman de</italic>
