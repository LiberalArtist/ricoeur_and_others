         <p>Engaging Bonhoeffer documents the extraordinary impact of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s life and writing on later thought. Despite his lasting legacy, little substantial scholarship has been conducted in this area. In this magisterial collection, leading international scholars fill this striking gap and critically demonstrate the ways in which Bonhoeffer has been one of the most inspirational writers of the twentieth century. In addition to shedding light on the different trajectories that Bonhoeffer’s work may forge, Engaging Bonhoeffer offers a critical window through which to view the ideas of many leading theological voices.</p>

                     <p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer was one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. His<italic>Life Together</italic>and<italic>Discipleship</italic>are considered to be spiritual classics, and few theological works have made as much of an impact as<italic>Letters and Papers from Prison</italic>upon publication. Although far from uncontroversial, it is also clear that Bonhoeffer’s involvement in the German resistance has also been a significant factor in his appreciation.</p>
                     <p>But who actually is this Bonhoeffer? After 70 years of scholarship, have we finally figured him out? Until relatively recently, Eberhard Bethge’s magisterial work,<italic>Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography</italic>, had been the authoritative version</p>

                     <p>The transmission of the thought of Dietrich Bonhoeffer to the English-speaking world in the 1950s and 1960s owed a unique debt to two British theologians: Ronald Gregor Smith (1913–68) and John A. T. Robinson (1919–83). Bonhoeffer played an important role in their respective theologies, and they both, albeit in very different ways, brought Bonhoeffer to the fore in academic and popular debate.</p>
                     <p>As a martyr-figure under Nazism, Dietrich Bonhoeffer was highly publicized in the English-speaking world from very soon after his death in 1945. The first English editions of his major writings appeared at regular intervals from 1948</p>

Fiske’s article, “Theology Without God,”¹ outlining the thought of a group of theologians exploring the idea of the “death of God.” The following April,<italic>Time</italic>followed suit, with John T. Elson’s in-depth analysis of new ways of thinking about God that were gaining ground in the United States and elsewhere. William Hamilton, referred to in both articles, considers this period to be that in which the media event of the death of God occurred,² though the theological developments it covered had begun four years before.</p>

                     <p>It may seem an odd thing to think and speak of the influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Karl Barth. Born in 1886, Barth was a half-generation older than Bonhoeffer (born 1906). Bonhoeffer was only twelve years old when Barth published his theological epoch making<italic>Romerbrief</italic>. Bonhoeffer studied Barth’s work and was influenced by him as a student, such that his<italic>Habilitationsschrift, Act and Being</italic>, was written in large part in dialogue with Karl Barth’s work. Even though this work contains critical elements,¹ this criticism should be seen within a shared discourse—a discourse established by Barth into which Bonhoeffer enters.</p>

                     <p>Reinhold Niebuhr and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were separated both by ideas and experience, but united in their most important convictions. They differed theologically, a difference apparent in their different interpretations of the Sermon on the Mount. They came from different backgrounds, and they saw the events of the twentieth century from different sides of the Atlantic. Yet despite these differences, each wanted to make a place for faithful action that would change the course of the political crisis through which they were living, and both understood the moral risks involved in that kind of action. The idea of responsibility—<italic>Verantwortung</italic>—bore</p>

                     <p>As this volume makes abundantly clear, Bonhoeffer’s influence has travelled far and wide. However, it perhaps finds its most concentrated and controversial manifestation in the 1960s with the rise of liberation and radical theology.¹ Both perspectives used Bonhoeffer to revolutionize doctrinal hermeneutics, stripping away the suffocating layers that a powerful, privileged, Western interpretation had laid over our perception of God. However, it was not just in the realm of doctrine, but also ethics, that such a revolutionary archaeology came to light. In 1966 Joseph Fletcher published his immensely popular<italic>Situation Ethics</italic>, which claimed to challenge the very fabric of more</p>

                     <p>It appears there is little scope for establishing the true nature and extent of Bonhoeffer’s influence on Hauerwas since there are few places where the latter explicitly engages with the former. In Hauerwas’s recent memoir,<italic>Hannah’s Child</italic>(2010), Bonhoeffer is barely mentioned; Karl Barth and John Howard Yoder, by contrast, are credited several times for shaping his thinking.¹ Indeed, Bonhoeffer’s name does not appear even once in Hauerwas’s seminal work<italic>The Peaceable Kingdom</italic>(1983)—not even in the section entitled “On What I Owe to Whom” at the beginning of the book.²</p>

                     <p>Liberation theology is one of the most important and provocative theological developments of the last century. Although it was largely forged in Latin America in distinction from the theologies of Western Europe and North America, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is often cited as a significant inspiration. Julio de Santa Ana and Beatriz Melano, Methodist theologians from Uruguay and Brazil respectively, offer moving first-hand testimony of Bonhoeffer’s impact on the development of Protestant liberation theology from its beginnings in the early 1950s—twenty years before Gustavo Gutiérrez’s seminal work,<italic>A Theology of Liberation</italic>, brought a systematic overview to the attention of the West.¹</p>

But what of Bonhoeffer’s life and work did she have in mind when she penned those words? As this this essay will show, Dorothee Soelle engaged with a wide range of Bonhoeffer’s thought and, as with many other liberational theologians, found particular inspiration in his prison theology.² This engagement was never at the expense of her own original and often provocative thoughts, or her critical reflections on Bonhoeffer’s work.

                     <p>Bonhoeffer lived out much of his theological existence in eastern Germany. He was a man of wide international and ecumenical vision. Yet, between his birth in Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1906 and his terminal imprisonment in Berlin in 1943–45, the better part of Bonheoffer’s life and work had its centre of gravity in the historic Prussian city of Berlin and the eastern German provinces of Silesia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania. It was at the behest of the Old Prussian Union Council of Brethren that he led the illegal Confessing Church seminary at Zingst/Finkenwalde and subsequent collective pastorates in “the</p>

It took Bonhoeffer very little time to realize that Ebeling was an exceptionally gifted theological thinker; it is fair to say that Bonhoeffer discovered the theological genius in Ebeling. On his own initiative, Bonhoeffer wrote to Martin Albertz, superintendent of the Confessing Church responsible for theological education, to recommend Ebeling for further theological education, stating: “I consider him to be an extraordinarily gifted and capable scholar and theologian…</p>

                     <p>Paul Ricoeur was one of the leading French philosophers of the twentieth centuries. He was also one of the most erudite. From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.</p>
