      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.</p>

                     <p>This work explores the philosophy and nature of film archiving in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) through an analysis of the role played by Jonathan Dennis, firstly at the New Zealand Film Archive, Ngā Kaitiaki o ngā Taonga Whitiāhua (NZFA), from 1981 until 1990 and thereafter as a freelance film curator until his death in 2002. The construction of a film archive in the early 1980s offers a valuable moment in which to analyse the wider purpose and the more specific process for the formation of a film archive. As a national institution presenting materials from the past, an archive quickly</p>

                     <p>The cultural practice of archiving physical materials in dedicated institutions emerges from European museums and libraries and is adapted by film archives, which over time have developed their own styles most appropriate to the media which they house. In examining the literature on the physical archive it becomes quickly apparent that at times the pragmatic everyday aspects of archiving can seem very far removed from the more philosophical discussion, and that archivists may be under-resourced and overworked to the point where they take for granted the perspectives which ingrain their practice. The divide between the everyday work and the philosophical</p>

                     <p>Barry Barclay described Jonathan Dennis’ work and his “stumbling prescience back in the first years …” which “… showed, at least in film archive circles, certainly in this country and perhaps internationally too, how he was much ahead of his time” (Barclay, 2005 p. 107). Conal McCarthy’s text,<italic>Museums and Māori: Heritage Professionals Indigenous Collections Current Practice</italic>(2011) also briefly commented on Dennis’ work during the early 1980s which he said “demonstrated through an active public programme and community outreach how a small cultural organisation such as the archive could begin to take on board Māori values and practices” (McCarthy</p>

                     <p>During the late 1970s and 1980s period in which Dennis was locating and collecting film materials, social and political shifts were occurring in NZ. Jonathan Dennis was one figure in a wider landscape, and the previous chapter has described his personal experience as well as the development of the Film Commission and Film Archive. We now move to the parallel macro-social movements and cultural shifts which meant indigenous peoples began to speak more openly about their experiences and concerns. This chapter focusses on the origins of material which is held by the NZFA, which includes significant early ethnographic films featuring</p>

                     <p>Within its first decade, the NZFA developed from its “very European” origins (Dennis, 1989 p. 10) into an institution which had a working document called The Constitution/Kaupapa in which the Treaty of Waitangi principles were incorporated and acknowledged as the founding document of the nation.⁹¹ In particular the Archive developed an understanding of Article Two of the Treaty which referred to “taonga”, as we have seen, a concept which would alter the manner in which institutions in New Zealand would engage with Māori materials (McCarthy, 2011). As set out in the previous chapter, in the 1970s there was a re-evaluation</p>

                     <p>When filmmaker Peter Wells made an audiovisual recording of Jonathan Dennis at his house as Dennis was dying of cancer in late 2001, he used a small hand-held digital camera which he felt was less intrusive than a film camera which would have required a crew. Wells admits this made for “an amateurishly shot home video”, but felt “it wasn’t that kind of massive invasion that you used to get with film. I was just there as a friend, really, and it was part of the privilege of being there” (Wells cited in Cardy, 2004). The edited footage from this</p>

It will demonstrate how Dennis’ practice was a creative endeavour and a collaborative venture which sought, through remembering rather than forgetting the colonial history of NZ and the South Pacific, to trouble the contemporary moment. Stephen Turner’s analysis of settler culture and its effects is employed to consider Dennis’ practice.¹⁴⁰ In addition Homi Bhaba’s concept of hybridity is investigated in relation to one of Dennis’</p>
