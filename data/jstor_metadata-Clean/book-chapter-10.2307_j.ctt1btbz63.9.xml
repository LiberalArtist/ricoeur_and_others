         <p>"Identity" has become a core concept of the social and cultural sciences. Bringing together perspectives from sociology, anthropology, psychology, history, and literary criticism, this book offers a comprehensive and critical overview on how this concept is currently used and how it relates to memory and constructions of historical meaning.</p>

Derived from ‘<italic>idem</italic>,’ the word’s semantic field ranges from ‘the sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances; the condition or fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else; individually, personally’ to its use in logic and mathematics and asks the question, how something can remain the same despite time and inevitable change. The word addresses at the same time the ‘condition’ and the ‘fact’ of remaining the same person throughout the various phases of existence. It underlines the ‘continuity of the</p>

Nymph Leiriope, having been raped by the river-god Kephissos, gave birth to a son and a prophet pronounces the threat: ‘Narcissus live to a ripe old age provided he never knows himself.’ Nymph Echo, who was once punished with the loss of speech, falls in love with the young Narcissus but is rejected like all others who have succumbed to his beauty. Nemesis eventually hears Echo’s lament of spurned love and punishes Narcissus with unrequited love for himself. Narcissus, exhausted after the day’s hunt and resting by a spring, catches sight of a beautiful young man in the</p>

                     <p>Many formalised discourses of the human sciences—such as law, liberal political philosophy and neo-classical economics—work with a notion of the singular human being as a unit that is characterised by its indivisibility, for those reasons also called the individual. An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations. In liberal political theory, their capacity for rationality leads the individuals to enter into a social contract for their</p>

                     <p>‘Identity’ has been among the most central concepts in 20<sup>th</sup>century psychology and sociology. It acquired its significance, which has persisted in all essentials until today, particularly in the context of pragmatist, interactionist and psychoanalytical thought,—even if the term played no role in the work of either Sigmund Freud or William James, but rather only in subsequent attempts to develop their theories of the subject and the self (Straub, 1991, 1994). Of course the remarkable career of ‘identity’ is due especially to certain works that were still close to the sources of psychoanalysis and pragmatism, even if they were</p>

                     <p>In recent debates, notions of identity are predominantly seen as coined within the framework of modernity and subsequently criticised by postmodern thought. This chapter will explore the relation of these two modes of thinking with regard to the term identity. Attention will be focused on the controversial question of the relation of myth to the identities of the West (e.g. individual, group and national identity), and the objective will be to explore how this relation can become a philosophical testing ground for a notion of political identity that is far removed from any hegemonic claims over the various<italic>Lebenswelten</italic>, and</p>

                     <p>Within the field of cultural studies discussions on the relationship between researcher and the subject(s) of research in recent years have mainly been held under the heading of ‘representation.’ The term, as it has generally been applied, is founded on an epistemological assumption: the notion of knowledge as the mirror of reality. This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted. The theory of knowledge involved in this conception</p>

                     <p>The revival of interest in cultural identity, now a key issue in world politics and likely to remain so for some time, is an outcome of the end of the so-called Cold War. The Cold War order that had defined world politics and had assumed economic and political bipolarity is no longer dominant. ‘Culture’ has been rediscovered in an effort to explain obvious differences between states (Huntington, 1993). However, in view of the seemingly endless conflicts in many parts of the world it is increasingly doubtful whether we can justly understand and interpret conflicting realities on the basis of our</p>

                     <p>‘<italic>Je est un autre</italic>’ (‘I is an other’) wrote Arthur Rimbaud in 1871, at a time when this statement may still have been understood as a provocation. Ever since the dawn of the postmodern era, however, we are constantly offered new theoretical arguments to persuade us of the plurality and the frailness of the I. It is commonplace nowadays to talk of the individual as a representational construct that is conditioned, manufactured and manipulated by language, images and society, a construct that can even be artificially portrayed. The subject, so the argument runs, emerges precisely because it is<italic>subjected</italic>to</p>

                     <p>When all had been destroyed, demolished and obliterated, a voice began to speak: ‘Mother Rahel / weeps no longer. Hauled over / all the weeped things’—a poem of Paul Celan’s from the cycle<italic>Fadensonnen</italic>of 1968 (1990: 202). Rahel weeps no longer; no one is there who could mourn as Rahel mourned her children. ‘No longer’—a dominant temporal dimension in Celan’s poetry, an uncanny time, without relation to the present moment. It is past, unalterable, and related to a site that also no longer exists. ‘<italic>Rübergetragen / alles Geweinte</italic>’—’Hauled over /all the weeped things’—to another place,</p>

                     <p>There is consensus among historians and social scientists that collective identities can undergo thorough and sometimes radical processes of redefinition. Such changes of self-definition have been observed most clearly among populations that have located themselves in new historical contexts by long-distance migration and diasporic settlement. So much is clear, yet this consensus raises a tricky theoretical question. How is it possible that the same social agents can reaffirm putatively ancient ethnic or cultural cleavages in some situations, but can construct new identities and alternative or hybrid cultural forms in others? The answer I shall propose understands cultural identities as discursive</p>

                     <p>In the Western cultural and social sciences, one usually considers the existence of a nation from three main angles: 1) that of the existence of a national state, 2) of a community living within some well-defined borders, and 3) through national awareness, in which national history can play a central role. In the case of African history and historiography, it is necessary though to reconsider the question with the help of criteria which differ from those used to study its European counterpart:</p>

                     <p>It has become almost obligatory in recent work on the history of nationalism to insist that this very history has not and, for the time being, will not come to an end. History continues in the conflicts in Eastern Europe, in the Western revival of the nation as an acknowledged cultural category, and also in the ethnic con-flicts of postcolonial societies. Such observations presuppose that nationalism exists as such and that it possesses one single history, despite all evident differences. In contradistinction to phenomena such as Imperialism, Communism or National Socialism, which appear to be fixed in time and space,</p>

                     <p>Over the last two decades or so, a thriving cottage industry has developed dealing with the origins and genesis of fundamentalist movements around the globe. Yet the scholars, policy analysts and intelligence experts involved in this huge effort had precious little to say about why such movements survive, and even flourish at times. After all, the odds are pretty much against them, as evidenced by the fact that the membership turnover rate is high. The stringent behavioural requirements, typical of fundamentalist groups, stand in stark contrast to the anything-goes, hedonistic, open society around them. One can just pick up one’s</p>
