      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.</p>

                     <p>In truth, I’d like to speak of it as little as possible. I’d like to move toward an effacement of this name and of the whole corpus of references that follows it—a corpus that is already mostly effaced or has lost its vitality. But I do think it is important to follow the movement that this name has named: that of an exit from religion and of the expansion of the atheist world.</p>

                     <p>One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary Western societies is undoubtedly the phenomenon usually referred to as the “turn to religion,” “the post-secular,” or, more generally, the “return of the religious.” What at first sight appears to be a simple return to religious values, inspired by a critical rejection of the basic assumptions of modern secular culture, is in fact a refined dialogue with this culture, a dialogue in which religious and secular arguments often change places. This delicate relationship between religion and modernity manifests itself not only in daily practical discussions about the role of religion</p>

                     <p>We often take for granted that Western modernity has brought about a secularized, atheistic world, in which religion no longer dominates the public sphere. We are equally convinced that a world once ruled by heteronomy and faith has been developed into a world of autonomy and rationality—in other words, a world whose sense lay outside the world is thought to have given way to a world whose sense is situated within it. Indeed, one cannot deny that religion no longer plays the foundational and regulative role it once did, nor that society is no longer based (at least formally)</p>

                     <p>Jean-Luc Nancy often insists on the necessity of understanding the expression “deconstruction<italic>of</italic>Christianity” as a subjective genitive: the deconstruction of Christianity would be—in a still enigmatic sense—a selfdeconstruction. Commentators have often taken “deconstruction” to be an external intervention by a sovereign interpreter, as a gesture performed, often violently, on a text or some other object of thought. However, what would it mean for our understanding of deconstruction if it were, as Nancy insists (following Derrida himself ), a self-deconstruction? What would the deconstruction of Christianity mean if it were, first and foremost, the self-deconstruction of Christianity and</p>

According to Nancy, this sentence reveals the entire self-deconstructive truth operating at the heart of Christianity:</p>
                     <p>We could just as well understand that it [Christ’s body] must not be touched because it cannot be: it is not to be touched. Yet that does not mean that it is an ethereal or immaterial, a spectral</p>

                     <p>A striking example of what Jean-Luc Nancy calls the (self-)deconstruction of Christianity was already given by Ernst Kantorowicz in 1951. In his article “Pro Patria Mori in Medieval Political Thought,” he discusses a fundamental difference of opinion between two cardinals that occurred at the beginning of the Great War.¹ As Belgium was being occupied by German troops in the summer of 1914, Cardinal Mercier, the primate of Belgium, published a pastoral letter entitled “Patriotism and Endurance.” In it, he defended the position that Belgians were justified in experiencing their patriotism as “consecrated” and the German violation of their national dignity</p>

                     <p>In the previous part of this book, the deconstruction of Christianity has been presented as an analysis of the complex relation between modern culture and religion. As Nancy carries it out, this analysis is not simply a form of “deconstructive activity”—deconstruction as a means to investigate an object—but an examination of Christianity’s self-deconstruction. The interplay between religion and modernity brings to the fore a dynamic of self-deconstruction, in which both are involved in a constant process of “turning away from themselves” and “leaving themselves behind.” This retreat from self, Nancy suggests, may be a movement that is as</p>

                     <p>As Parts I and II have demonstrated, Nancy conceives Christianity—or more generally, monotheism—as a religion that is marked from the outset by a secular structure. This secular structure consists not in the proposition of a unique God but in the way this God is present in the world. What is most important in the shift from polytheism to monotheism is thus not a reduction in the number of gods but a rearticulation of the relation between God and the world. Whereas polytheism affirms the immediate presence of gods and believes them to inhabit and organize the world, monotheism</p>

                     <p>In<italic>Dis-enclosure</italic>, Jean-Luc Nancy suggests that in Western culture “God’s act of creation” has provided “the least bad analogical recourse” for designating the “void-artist-body [<italic>corps-vide-artiste</italic>]” (<italic>D</italic>69/99; first trans. modified). Working backward, from this we can posit, still speaking analogically, that God’s act of creation generated the myth or concept of creation that is involved in the process and results of literary writing. Such a myth of creation should be understood in at least two senses: first, myth as an originary tale (<italic>récit</italic>) of foundation that has come down to us via the Judeo-Christian tradition (Genesis), and second, myth in</p>

                     <p>Jean-Luc Nancy is without doubt a post-Marxist, post-Heideggerian and—I would add—post-Arendtian thinker.¹ His ontology bears traces of all three, but this ontology flows, above all, from an attempt to think creation ex nihilo after the death of the creator God. Even now, so long after Nietzsche, and so very long after Descartes set the process of secularization in motion, it is a thinking that is only uneasily, hesitantly under way. We have gone beyond God, as Nancy puts it, but in a direction still too much determined by the thought of his death and by the necro-monotheist tradition</p>

Nancy suggests that art does not merely illustrate religion. Instead, the two are involved in the same self-deconstructive movement or in a process of a mutual dis-enclosure. Whereas art provides the sensible articulation of the internal destabilization of the religious mode, the unstable core in religion—an origin in its displacement—forms an integral part of the condition of art.</p>

                     <p>To a degree, Christianity can and must be considered a powerful confirmation of metaphysics. Jean-Luc Nancy clearly affirms this inevitable complicity of Christianity with a metaphysics of presence, and therefore with a certain trajectory of metaphysical thinking withinWestern and European philosophy, at the beginning of<italic>Dis-enclosure</italic>(<italic>D</italic>6–7/15–17). It recalls the analysis of the Eucharist in his earlier work Corpus, according to which the phrase<italic>Hoc est enim corpus meum</italic>is seen as an assertion, tirelessly repeated, of the immediate presence of God, an affirmation that “God’s<italic>body</italic>is<italic>there</italic>” (<italic>C</italic>3).

                     <p>The idea of creation lies at the core of the four domains in which Jean-Luc Nancy’s thinking is most influential today: thinking about the world (one would traditionally refer to this as ontology); thinking about art and, in particular, the image (i.e., “aesthetics”); thinking about the sacred and religion; and thinking about politics. In this essay, I will explore the common dynamic that draws them together, since I believe a grasp of this dynamic is crucial for understanding Nancy’s thinking and the radical challenges it poses.</p>

                     <p>Art has always maintained a special relationship with the divine—struggling to figure it, to present it, or to negate it. As Jean-Luc Nancy might formulate it, art bears witness to the opening of the divine, or to the divine as opening: in other words, to the world as it is. It is “homogeneous with religions,” but even within religion, it is never religious (<italic>M1</italic>99/157; trans. modified). Art, specifically the image, occupies an aporetic place with regard to religion insofar as by virtue of its impossible task—to figure the invisible—it deconstructs religion from within.</p>
