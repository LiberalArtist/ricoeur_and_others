         <p>
            <italic>Moses and Monotheism</italic>, Freud's last major book and the only one specifically devoted to a Jewish theme, has proved to be one of the most controversial and enigmatic works in the Freudian canon. Among other things, Freud claims in the book that Moses was an Egyptian, that he derived the notion of monotheism from Egyptian concepts, and that after he introduced monotheism to the Jews he was killed by them. Since these historical and ethnographic assumptions have been generally rejected by biblical scholars, anthropologists, and historians of religion, the book has increasingly been approached psychoanalytically, as a psychological document of Freud's inner life-of his allegedly unresolved Oedipal complex and ambivalence over his Jewish identity.</p>
         <p>In<italic>Freud's</italic>
            <italic>Moses</italic>a distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writing<italic>Moses and Monotheism.</italic>He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."</p>

                     <p>The joke catches our attention on two counts; first, because the precocious Itzig seems already to display a talent for what Paul Ricoeur, referring to Freud's own method, has elegantly called a “hermeneutics of</p>

                     <p>That Freud should have turned to history to solve his Jewish riddles comes as no surprise. Historicism of one kind or another has been a dominant characteristic of modern Jewish thought since the early nineteenth century, while the “historical” bent of psychoanalysis itself is, theoretically and therapeutically, part of its very essence.</p>
                     <p>But if Moses and Monotheism presents itself ultimately as history, what kind of history could Freud possibly be expected to write? In 1934 he was seventy-eight years old. His major discoveries lay behind him and had been integrated into a coherent whole. Predictably, the only Jewish history that</p>

                     <p>Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.</p>

Whence this compulsion (for it is not merely a caprice) I cannot fully articulate even to myself.

All this will probably strike you as impudence,</p>
