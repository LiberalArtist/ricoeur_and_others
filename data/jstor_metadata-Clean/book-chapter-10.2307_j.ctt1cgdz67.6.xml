      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>One of the difficulties in studying the theology of Wesleyan hymns and sacred poems is that it is couched in a literary and liturgical art form that does not fit into the usual intellectual paths defined over the last two centuries for the study of theology, which tends to be a prose endeavour. Charles Wesley composed a number of thematic collections of hymns, such as those based on the Christian year, e.g., Hymns for the Nativity of our Lord, Hymns for our Lord’s Resurrection, Hymns for Ascension-Day, Hymns for Whitsunday, but his lyrics on a plethora of theological themes, such as sanctification, perfection, holiness, etc., are scattered throughout his over 9,000 hymns and poems from a writing and publishing career that spanned almost fifty years. One of the primary purposes of this volume is to bring together a collection of hymns and sacred poems representative of Charles Wesley’s theological thinking. The texts are organized within a theological outline in order to make the study of his theological ideas and concepts more readily accessible, though many of them could be placed in diverse theological categories. This is a welcome addition to Wesleyan scholarship and a book that all those who sing Wesley's hymns will be interested in.</p>

                     <p>The term<italic>lyrical theology</italic>requires considerable definition if it is to be used with clarity and integrity. Obviously the noun<italic>theology</italic>is itself problematic in terms of what it means to speak of a “God word” or a “word about God.” Nonetheless, its constant usage, though in diverse ways, in the arenas of church and theological science makes it a familiar term used with confidence and regularity. It acquires many adjectival modifiers:<italic>systematic</italic>theology,<italic>pastoral</italic>theology,<italic>biblical</italic>theology, etc. Here we speak, however, of a<italic>lyrical</italic>theology.</p>

                     <p>Some years ago I wrote an article for<italic>Theology Today</italic>entitled “Hymns are Theology,”² in which I made the case for a more serious consideration of this genre of sacred literature as theology. In that article I maintained, “The hymns of the church<italic>are</italic>theology. They are theological statements: the church’s lyrical, theological commentaries on Scripture, liturgy, faith, action, and hosts of other subjects which call the reader and singer to faith, life, and Christian practice.”³</p>
                     <p>In the years since the appearance of that article, I have written about this subject in the previous chapter using the phrase<italic>lyrical theology</italic>

                     <p>Having established some of the parameters of lyrical theology and that Charles Wesley may be viewed and interpreted as a lyrical theologian, how are we to read his sacred poetry? This question is not raised in reference to established canons of literary interpretation of poetry, which have been discussed in many works on English literature. The question is posed primarily here in terms of the historical context within which Charles Wesley emerged as a sacred poet and the diverse theological problems facing eighteenth-century Christians in Great Britain. Both the historical and theological contexts are extremely significant in shaping Charles’s poetical</p>

                     <p>Wesley’s hymnody is often read as a sacred literary corpus in isolation, but to do so is a great injustice to his work. Literary critics have also made a great mistake by considering hymn literature as unworthy of careful study. Charles Wesley is a man of his times whose hymns emerge from his education and literary influences of the period. Donald Davie has rightly observed in his book<italic>A Gathered Church: The Literature of the English Dissenting Interest, 1700–1930</italic>:</p>

                     <p>Since the importance of reading Wesley’s poetry in the context of the time in which he lived has been emphasized, it is essential to set the Wesleyan poetical sources from which the poetical selections for this volume have been drawn in their own context. As one reads the poems, one should refer back to the contextual explanations for the sources listed below in order to grasp more fully how, when, and why the poems were published. In some instances this will be more obvious than others. It is hoped that these contextual elaborations will assist the reader in the understanding</p>
