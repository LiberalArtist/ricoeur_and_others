      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Scholars from the United States, Latin America, and Oceania reflect in this volume on the importance of contextual theology for the twenty-first century. Contextual theology offers fresh voices from every culture, and not just from the West. It calls for new ways of doing theology that embrace cultural values, but at the same time challenges them to the core. And it opens up new and fresh topics out of which and about which people can theologise. If the church is to be faithful to its mission, it needs to provide a feast at which all can be nourished.</p>

                     <p>Contextual theology is increasingly central for Christian existence throughout the world. It is central because Christianity is growing in the Global South, that is, in the world of contextual theologies, or<italic>theologiae in loco</italic>as they were first called. It is central because these contextual theologies of the Global South are lived out in communities’ lives but not always recognized for what they are. It is central because often in the Global North, and in the Global South, too, these contextual theologies are regarded as of little significance for Christian existence throughout the world, including in their own places.

                     <p>The title of my presentation is an invitation to explore the contributions of liberation theology in Latin America and the Caribbean and the challenges it poses to the twenty-first century. I come as a witness that takes seriously the context in which this theology was developed. As the late Taiwanese theologian Shoki Coe, Director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches in the 1970s, used to stress, contextualizing theology as an ongoing process becomes a key hermeneutical principle both in educating for the ministry and promoting a relevant theology.¹</p>

                     <p>In my correspondence with Katalina Tahaafe-Williams in the months before this conference, I asked for a suggestion for the topic or theme for my second talk. Of course, I presumed that the first talk would address the theme of the conference—“What Has Contextual Theology to Offer the Church of the Twenty-First Century?”—but I was not sure what would be the best follow-up to it. Katalina suggested the topic of mission, especially the understanding of it as developed by my colleague Roger Schroeder and me in our 2004 book,<italic>Constants in Context: A Theology of Mission for Today</italic>.¹ In</p>

                     <p>The World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1910, has long been regarded as the historic landmark of world mission and the modern ecumenical movement. It is important to remember that one of the outcomes of Edinburgh 1910 was a desire to seek and attain unity in mission. Particularly, Commission VIII’s report and discussion emphasizes the importance of practical measures between mission societies of different nationalities and denominations to find agreements in the “mission fields” in order to avoid competition, duplication, and division of missionary efforts.¹ The commission insisted on the importance of learning to know each other, of</p>

                        <italic>What has contextual theology to offer the church of the twenty-first century?</italic>This is the question with which the conference at United Theological College grappled, and to which this book has proposed some tentative answers. Naturally, the future will answer the question more fully than we ever could here, but we do think that the original conference and these eight essays have pointed very much in the right direction.</p>
                     <p>In the first essay, Stephen Bevans proposed that contextual theology in this century will offer new methods, new voices, and a new agenda. We have already seen each of these new</p>
