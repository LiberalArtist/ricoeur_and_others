         <p>Every life, and every land and people, has reasons for lament and complaint. This collection of essays explores the biblical foundations and the contemporary resonances of lament literature. This new work presents a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out of joint are explored. These responses arise from Scripture, from within the liturgy of the church, and from beyond the church; in contemporary life (the racially conflicted land of Aotearoa- New Zealand, secular music concerts and cyber-space). The book thus reflects upon theological and pastoral handling of such experience, as it bridges these different worlds. It brings together in conversation specialists from different fields of academy and church to provide a resource for integrating faith and scholarship in dark places.</p>

                     <p>Every life, and every land and people, has reasons for lament and complaint. This collection of essays explores the biblical foundations and the contemporary resonances of lament literature. The editors of this book and many of its contributors have strong connections with Aotearoa, New Zealand. It is fitting, therefore, that the book begins with a lament liturgy responding to the recent Christchurch earthquake (22 February 2011). It ends with a piece considering the “Holy Land” through the eyes of the Shulamith of the Song of Songs. Between these framing laments, a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out</p>

                     <p>The claim by Shakespeare's Juliette “What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet” is often quoted to claim that naming is arbitrary. Yet what we call things matters. For our classifying, and hence our naming, in part defines what we can and will perceive. This chapter investigates three approaches to naming the genre present in the speeches commonly known as “the confessions of Jeremiah” in order to uncover three responses to the dark times. While these are different they also often coincide and collaborate as our spirits respond to disaster</p>

The chapter impresses upon readers a picture of unthinkable reversal: the impossible has occurred and everything is the opposite of what it ought to be. Gold has lost its lustre, sacred jewels are worthless, and precious gold is broken like clay pots (4: 1–2). כהעמי is cruel, suckling infants thirst, and those used to rich delicacies starve for lack of food (4: 3–5). The formerly finelyclad scurry around in the muck, radiant leaders have lost their glamour, and in monstrous</p>

                     <p>This chapter will employ the intertextual relationship between Ps 22 and the book of Job to demonstrate the tendency toward the personi-fication of lament in Hebrew literature. First, I will put this connection in a wider hermeneutical context by outlining five similar intertextual connections between the psalm and the wider Hebrew tradition: the life of David, other Old Testament books, the New Testament, the Midrash, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. This brief summary will demonstrate both the wide, powerful influence of Ps 22 in the Hebrew understanding of suffering and the method of<italic>relecture</italic>with its reciprocal effect on the</p>

                     <p>Chapters 16:1—17:16 of the book of Job contain the fifth speech of Job. Although containing a variety of themes, the main topic in 16:7–14 does not seem to be the suffering of humanity as in the previous four speeches, but the suffering of Job.¹ As in the former laments, Job argues that the main reason for his distress is God himself. However, in 16:7–14, Job pours out his complaints against God in a more intense manner, and gives by far the most merciless and severe depictions of Divine animosity in the whole book.² The depiction of God</p>

                     <p>The affinity between Isa 63:7—64:11 and the psalms of communal lament has long been noted.¹ Similarities with the book of Lamentations, and the penitential prayers of Ezra 9 and Neh 9 have also been identified.² Discussion as to the relationship between these texts has frequently been based within the methodological framework of form and/or tradition criticism,³ however, within this chapter, Isa 63:7—64:11 will be discussed from the perspective of the rhetorical and ideological climate of the exilic and post-exilic period, drawing on the literary framework of Mikhail Bakhtin.⁴ The chapter seeks to argue that Isaiah 63:7—64:11, through</p>

                     <p>Lament and penitential prayer are closely related. Both are responses to suffering and crisis yet the ways in which they address God and the assumptions they make about the relationship and the allocation of responsibility are quite different. In the light of recent research on penitential prayer I want to re-examine aspects of the relationship between such prayers and the laments. In the process I want to look again at the implications for theology and Christian practice that were highlighted in seminal work by Claus Westermann and Walter Brueggemann.¹</p>
                     <p>Westermann pointed out that prayers prompted by suffering and crisis transitioned</p>

                     <p>When should we lament¹ and intercede and when should we turn to God in penitence or stand before God’s awesomeness in stunned silence? Is it possible to know which approach to take when we draw near to God in supplication? Does it depend on the quality of the sin, the size of the punishment, or on our own feelings of guilt or innocence? Moreover, are lament and intercession always open possibilities or are there times when these kinds of responses are inappropriate?</p>
                     <p>Any answer to these questions lies beyond the scope of an academic paper. The present paper is inspired</p>

                     <p>The book of Lamentations was birthed in order to bring a deep and profound grief before the throne of Yhwh in the context of communal worship. It found ongoing relevance for the people of God in the worship of Jewish and Christian communities over the centuries and, if it is to function as<italic>Holy Scripture</italic>today, it must do so by finding a place in the ongoing worshipping life of synagogue and church. This chapter offers some reflections on<italic>Christian</italic>theological interpretation of Lamentations in doxological contexts.</p>

However, he brought me into the theological seminar on “Lament,” to contribute from my own discipline. I was well aware of the earlier earthquake in Christchurch (I had just been there on my travels), as well as of the more tragic mining disaster on the West Coast; and the raw memories of these events were sobering factors in my preparation and presentation.

                     <p>The grief that accompanies loss is a universal experience. Most cultures have developed mourning rituals to express this grief. Among these rituals are laments. Laments are common and take a variety of forms. Laments may be elaborate poems, or sung chants, or “tuneful weeping.”² They usually involve mourning, but not just for the dead. There are laments about the fall of great cities, about emigration from the points of view of both those who leave and those who are left behind, and laments related to marriage rituals as a bride leaves to join her husband’s household.</p>

                     <p>In this chapter I suggest that the form-critically identified laments of the Hebrew Bible can be understood via the performance concept of “framing.” In art, drama, and literature the frame lifts the work or event to a heightened consciousness and provides a context for practitioners and audiences to interact. My interest is in the link between frame (form) and content. I argue that the lament form provides a literary framework for the expression of anguish by empowering those who are suffering to name their pain, despite the constraints of the form that generally culminate in a leaning towards hope.

                     <p>There has been a surge of scholarship around lament in recent times. Although the initial impetus for this resurgence can be found in the works of both Westermann and Brueggemann, the focus on lament has moved beyond the boundaries of biblical studies and has taken on a particular urgency in light of global events since the turn of the millennium.¹ The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen tragedies which have touched the consciousness of people worldwide. Headline examples include the attack on the world trade centre in 2001, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, terrorist bombings in Bali</p>

The promises of new technologies and media promotes slogans, such as Apple’s “There’s an App for That,” that assert no matter what problem you face, technology can solve it. But even in this bright and shiny world the words of the Teacher still ring true, for there is much that is not new under the sun: bad things happen to good people; good things happen to bad</p>
