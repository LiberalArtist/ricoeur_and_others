      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.</p>

                     <p>The twentieth century is now but a memory, existing in the minds, souls, and seared flesh of those who survived it and we who write and read the words that become our past. Theology—whether Jewish or Christian—is embedded in the past and the command to remember, or to forget. But remembering or forgetting are both unstable and unreliable. We remember and we forget but in part, as individuals and as communities. We remember things that we would prefer to forget, or seek to blot out those things which make life intolerable or are an offense. Alana Vincent’s book</p>

                     <p>This is a book about living with the past—not about memory itself<italic>per se</italic>, but about the process of constructing cultural memory, about the negotiation, implicit or explicit, between what is remembered, transmuted into narrative, handed on from generation to generation, and what is forgotten, unspoken, overlooked. My underlying assumption is that the understanding of the past generated by such a process plays an essential role in shaping attitudes and actions of individuals and societies in the present. This understanding (“memory”) is at times difficult to distinguish from the process of its formation (“memorialization”); the former is often the</p>

                     <p>At the end of every winter, in the month of Adar, the normal order of Torah readings is supplemented with four special readings which, taken together, lay the foundation for the observance of Pesach-Shavuot,² which begins in the following month of Nissan. The readings are, in order, Shekalim (Exod 30:11–16), Zakhor (cited above), Parah (Num 19:1), and HaChodesh (Exod 12:1–20).³ One may argue that these readings lay out four essential pillars of Judaism: charitable giving, remembrance, ritual purity, and observance of sanctified time.⁴ These four areas are firmly intertwined, and a discussion of any one will necessarily involve</p>

Western culture has also had a lengthy relationship of rereading with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome—this is the origin of the “Western philosophical tradition,” which I contrasted with the Jewish tradition of biblical interpretation in chapter one. In this chapter, I will turn to a brief examination of Sophocles’<italic>Antigone</italic>and its history of interpretation as a window into the way that discourse over mourning and ownership of the dead has developed.

                     <p>In October 1914, an officer of the British Red Cross by the name of Fabian Ware, accompanying a superior on an inspection tour, visited Béthune Cemetery in Northern France. There, he saw “a number of English graves all with plain but carefully made wooden crosses on them,” but no sign that anybody had recorded their presence or made arrangements for their maintenance.¹ In conversation with his superior, Dr. Stewart, Ware committed his unit to locating and registering “all the British graves the Unit could find.”² Over the next three years, the scope of his project grew.

The angles at which this corridor is cut across by two other, nearly identical, passageways are more reminiscent of a funhouse than a hospital.

                     <p>The Great War remains an important touchstone of Canadian cultural memory, filtered through the redemptive metanarrative of Western Christianity. It is therefore of interest to both theologians and scholars of religion and nationalism to carefully observe the manner in which that memory is either supported or challenged by the memory of the Holocaust, which, in spite of academic protestations about Roma and Sinti and homosexuals and political prisoners, is generally treated as a particularly Jewish tragedy.

                     <p>This conclusion is not simple or satisfactory. It may seem to be barely a conclusion at all; this book, much like the two novels discussed in this chapter, may appear to terminate abruptly,<italic>en route</italic>to a destination but never actually arriving.
