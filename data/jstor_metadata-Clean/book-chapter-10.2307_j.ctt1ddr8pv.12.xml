      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Two languages-German and Romanian-inform the novels, essays, and collage poetry of Nobel laureate Herta Müller. Describing her writing as "autofictional," Müller depicts the effects of violence, cruelty, and terror on her characters based on her own experiences in Communist Romania under the repressive Nicolae Ceauşescu regime.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Herta Müller: Politics and Aesthetics</italic>explores Müller's writings from different literary, cultural, and historical perspectives. Part 1 features Müller's Nobel lecture, five new collage poems, and an interview with Ernest Wichner, a German-Romanian author who has traveled with her and sheds light on her writing. Parts 2 and 3, featuring essays by scholars from across Europe and the United States, address the political and poetical aspects of Müller's texts. Contributors discuss life under the Romanian Communist dictatorship while also stressing key elements of Müller's poetics, which promises both self-conscious formal experimentation and political intervention.</p>
         <p>One of the first books in English to thoroughly examine Müller's writing, this volume addresses audiences with an interest in dissident, exile, migration, experimental, and transnational literature.</p>

                     <p>Two languages inform the writings of Nobel Prize laureate Herta Müller: German as well as Romanian bear on Müller’s novels, essays, and collage poetry. Born in 1953 in German-speaking Nitzkydorf—a Banat-Swabian village in southwestern Romania—Müller grew up as part of a linguistic and ethnic minority in a Communist state. Her writing career began with a fictionalized portrayal of the village of her childhood, an isolated backward community deeply influenced by National Socialism and characterized by narrow-minded ethnocentrism. Romanian literary censorship, which had dramatically increased in the 1980s, delayed the publication of Müller’s first collection of short stories for</p>

                     <p>Herta Müller’s is a poor writing, or a writing that uses the poverty of means to escape, momentarily, a greater and much more profound poverty. The world presented in her writing, in a collision of verisimilitude and surrealism, is a world in which one makes do with very little; Müller’s Nobel Prize speech (titled “Every Word Knows Something of a Vicious Circle”), for example, is an extended meditation on words and things, starting from, and always coming back to, the handkerchief.¹ In a world outside of, or below, the consumer economy, small objects, passed from parent to child, assert themselves.</p>

I didn’t have a handkerchief. And because I didn’t, I would go back inside and get one. I never had a handkerchief because I would always wait for her question. The handkerchief was proof that my mother was looking after me in the morning. For the rest of the day I was on my own. The question “Do you have a handkerchief?” was an indirect display of affection. Anything more direct would</p>

He is a writer, translator, and editor, and he has served as the director of the Literaturhaus (Literary Institute, Berlin) since 2003. In 2004, Wichner accompanied Herta Müller and the poet Oskar Pastior on a research trip to the Ukraine, where they visited the remainders of a campsite to which Pastior had been deported in 1945 and where he worked as a forced laborer until 1949.

                     <p>Twenty years after the demise of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, Herta Müller still dedicates her writings to “all those whom dictatorships deprive of dignity every day,” as she declared in her Nobel Prize lecture. While her adopted country, the Federal Republic of Germany, proposed Müller for the award, it was her country of birth, Romania, that had inspired the writings that made her worthy of such a prize. Indeed it is her traumatic past under Nicolae Ceauşescu’s Communist yet nationalist dictatorship that this internationally acclaimed author constantly and obsessively revisits in her writings. This chapter aims at reconstructing the</p>

                     <p>Loneliness is an unnatural and unwanted state of isolation in which the individual cannot thrive.¹ It is not to be confused with solitude, which may be sought and savored. Loneliness is often seen as a feature of modernity, associated with the breakdown of traditional communities and extended family structures. In the second half of the twentieth century it was identified more as a product of Western capitalist societies, which tend to atom ize individuals, than of Eastern bloc societies. The latter attempted to unite their citizens through socialist values and central planning, while in practice often uniting them in disaffection.</p>

                     <p>Over the last fifteen years the emergence of groundbreaking work on trauma in literature and critical theory has made a profound impact both within and beyond the field of literature. This cutting-edge research has been applied to Herta Müller’s work by scholars such as Beverley Driver Eddy, Brigid Haines, and Lyn Marven, who have connected images and strategies of fragmentation and disruption with trauma theory. Müller surely represents and reflects upon the traumatic events of twentiethcentury Europe, as well as the cultural diversity of East Central Europe; she feels compelled to write about them (Glajar 2) and to show her</p>

                     <p>In his critique of Herta Müller’s<italic>Die blassen Herren mit den Mokkatassen</italic>, Anton G. Leitner has remarked that he considered the form of her collage poems, which he refers to as<italic>Schnipsellyrik</italic>, or cut-out poetry, trite and outdated; their genius lies “in the concurrence of fortuitous and calculated word deployment by a writer who can wield not just a pair of scissors.”¹</p>
                     <p>There have been many attempts to decipher Müller’s collages; many of them, like Leitner’s, concentrating on the texts and largely ignoring the artworks that accompany them.² Some note the similarities in appearance between her collage texts and those</p>

These objects, which transcend genres and languages, relentlessly reappear dispersed (and broken) throughout her oeuvre (regardless of their disfiguration) and map out a visible path to Müller’s process of remembering. In addition to empowering particular objects, this method highlights the new, more effortless mobility across borders, which resulted from the opening of the former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. I contend that this flexibility has allowed Müller to</p>

                     <p>After her Nobel Prize was announced, commentators never tired of emphasizing that Herta Müller lent her literary and political voice to the victims of Stalinism and the Ceauşescu dictatorship. Müller is without question a political author whose writing describes and indicts the mechanisms of surveillance and oppression and their effects on people. Harassment and surveillance by the authorities and secret police of the Romanian dictatorship frequently mark the day-to-day life of her protagonists. The living conditions of her characters have severely damaged them and considerably affected their perception of themselves and the world. What is interesting above all, in my</p>

                     <p>Herta Müller belongs to a generation of ethnic German writers born in Romania who were influenced by the rhetoric of the Aktionsgruppe Banat, a group that combined experimentation with realism. Among the influences on the Aktionsgruppe Banat, dismembered by the Romanian Securitate in 1975, critics count Franz Kafka, the surrealists,<italic>konkrete Poesie</italic>, the theater of the absurd,<italic>le nouveau roman</italic>, and New American lyric and pop art (Sterbling 75; Spiridon 75, 210, 214). Müller uses experimental literary techniques such as collage and montage, primarily as inherent components of her idiosyncratic verse. In this way, her work invokes multiple literary traditions</p>

                     <p>On May 11–13, 2000, eight authors came together at the University of Tübingen to speak on the topic “Zukunft! Zukunft?” [Future! Future?]. The lectures addressed the possibility of and limitations to thinking a notion of time that includes the idea of a future. Many sought to articulate a future-oriented indebtedness to past and present moments that could adequately represent subjective experience. Among these efforts was Herta Müller’s contribution, later published under the title “Einmal anfassen—zweimal loslassen” [Catch hold once—let go twice].¹ Though the essay underscores the inextricability of past and present, it also implies an important potential</p>
