                     <p>Long before the age of the megalopolis, movement has defined cities. As complex constellations of people, objects and signs, cities are spaces where social, political and historical relations undergo constant negotiation and where the realities and representations of urban life are in persistent and dynamic states of becoming. This is to say that each person’s experience of the city organizes an intricately shifting site for the production and exchange of meaning. Simply walking through the streets – choosing a particular path to follow, avoiding certain others – involves many acts of interpretation and mediation, ways of practising urban space that</p>

                     <p>Recognizing the inexhaustible quality of the urban flow of goods, capital and people that inform metropolitan life and in order to approach a means of interpreting urban travel writing, it is helpful to engage with a number of influential theoretical approaches for understanding cities. This chapter explores theories of the city along two main axes: first, as a material condition of the planning perspective, which is to say an urban environment concerned with function and place-making; and, second, as a narrative space, a space of practice where meanings are performed by subjects in places across space and time.

                     <p>As we have seen in the previous chapter, in constant tension with the representations of space of London’s orderly West End and tourist attractions are spaces of urban disorder, social ‘dysfunction’, and poverty that continually threaten to depose the institutional and ideological clarity of the figured city. For the French travellers examined in this chapter, spaces of disorder perform in correspondence and contrast with the monumentality of more official sites. Disorder is a trope that provides a key to analysing these travellers’ strategies for making meaning for London during the interwar period – in the case of Jacques Dyssord (1880–</p>

                     <p>The imaginative geographies of twentieth-century New York, a time when the city was considered by many to be the capital of the world (perhaps the last), provide the impetus for discussion in this chapter. While imperialist Europe may have dominated the nineteenth-century’s imagination of civilization, in the wake of two world wars, the twentieth century witnessed the dislocation of a geopolitics dominated by European imperialist expansion, and the establishment of a new global political order increasingly dominated by the capitalist market economy and American foreign policy. This shift of power within the West was also fundamental for the establishment of</p>

Taylor tells us that ‘from the beginning, the number one problem of modern social science has been modernity itself: that historically unprecedented amalgam of new practices and institutional forms (science, technology, industrial production, urbanization), of new ways of living (individualism, secularization, instrumental rationality); and of new forms of malaise (alienation, meaninglessness,</p>
