                     <p>We are familiar with the tension between quantitative and qualitative research in sociology, between data collection and analysis on the one hand and the recording of narrative on the other. One way to situate Pierre Bourdieu’s work in these terms is to understand it as an alternative response to the situation of the natural and cultural sciences identified by Jürgen Habermas.</p>
                     <p>Just less than half a century ago, Habermas bemoaned the fact that a gulf had developed between the natural sciences, which are taken to be concerned with the formulation of explanatory laws (‘nomological sciences’), and the human sciences, which</p>

                     <p>I believe that Pierre Bourdieu is best understood as a phenomenological sociologist and that, equally, responses to his work in the spirit of its production have also to be understood phenomenologically. I first offer a brief justification of that view. I then seek to clarify what I take to be the nature of Bourdieu’s phenomenological orientation before proceeding to an elaboration of its implications both for our understanding of Bourdieu’s work and for an assessment of the range of responses to his work presented in this volume. In the light of these preliminary remarks, I then offer reflections on each</p>

                     <p>The main purpose of this chapter is to examine Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity. The concept of reflexivity plays a pivotal role in Bourdieu’s attempt to develop a ‘critical sociology’ (<italic>sociologie critique</italic>), often referred to as ‘reflexive sociology’ in the Anglophone literature. Based on a thorough textual analysis of his key works, the chapter aims to demonstrate that the following twelve elements are particularly important to Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity: (1) ‘science’, (2) ‘vigilance’, (3) ‘consciousness’, (4) ‘self-awareness’, (5) ‘critique’, (6) ‘self-objectification’, (7) ‘distance-taking’ (8) ‘rupture’, (9) ‘epistemology’, (10) ‘historicization’, (11) ‘understanding’ and (12) ‘emancipation’. Although the concept of reflexivity</p>

                     <p>Since the turn of the century, the international reception of the work of Pierre Bourdieu has steadily gathered pace and taken on such a magnitude that we can say (with some exaggeration) that genetic structuralism now occupies the position of the hegemon within the global field of sociological theory, comparable perhaps to the one of structural functionalism in the post-war period. Nowadays, one can like or detest Bourdieu’s critical sociology; however, one cannot afford to ignore it. He is the main ‘attractor’ in the field of sociology (with Michel Foucault playing a similar role within the rival, anti-disciplinary field of</p>

This is the opening sentence of part 2 of<italic>Le métier de sociologue: Préalables épistémologiques</italic>(<italic>The craft of sociology: epistemological preliminaries</italic>), which Pierre Bourdieu coproduced with Jean-Claude Chamboredon and Jean-Claude Passeron in 1968 ([1968], 1991, 33). The co-authors proceeded to quote from Karl Marx and Max Weber to suggest that there was an epistemological principle articulated in the Saussurean statement that unified social science practice in spite of ideological differences, one that involves seeing science as ‘an instrument for breaking with naive realism’ ([1968], 1991, 33).

                     <p>In his mature life, especially after the eighties and the fall of the Berlin Wall, Pierre Bourdieu was one of the harshest critics of Europe as a political reality, or better as that political reality created and performed in the last decades of the twentieth century as the European Union (EU).¹</p>
                     <p>Bourdieu’s positions against the EU have attracted much attention among scholars and commentators, and political actors as well. However, Bourdieu’s relation with Europe cannot be reduced to his cries and attacks against Brussels, the EU rules, its institutional powers and its economic policies.

                     <p>In this essay, we examine the history of the Japanese reception of Pierre Bourdieu’s works generally, and his essays on Japan specifically, from the viewpoints of the principle of differentiation and the concept of capital, both regarding international knowledge transfer (Robbins 2012).¹ The Japanese modernization and industrialization processes are always embedded within a unique knowledge transfer process. Japanese modernization processes, especially during the Meiji era, are often identified as<italic>Wakon Yōsai</italic>(和魂洋才), which means ‘Japanese spirit, Western technology’ (Hirakawa 1971, 2004; Chew 2014).

                     <p>While verbal expressions, whether oral or written, sometimes fail to convey all that we wish to, and as precisely as we want to, this is seldom viewed as a limitation inherent in language itself. More often than not, it is attributed, with some justification, to a lack of adequate skills on the part of the speaker or author. Just as often, the fact that theoretical expressions in the social sciences are linguistically mediated is something that is taken for granted and regarded as unproblematic, while it is in the conceptual framework of the theory being considered that the source of</p>

                     <p>Pierre Bourdieu successfully constructed his sociology by combining the Durkheimian tradition with new developments in anthropology, ethnography, culture studies and education in post-war France. The core of Bourdieu’s writings concerns social space and reproduction: the relationship between the different forms of capital and their relations with inequality and power are perpetuated and reproduced in and through various fields, for example, education. Also, such ongoing and successful reproduction imposes a sense of cultural legitimacy and a social definition of reality. Bourdieu’s theoretical innovation contributed to a great extent to the establishment, as well as the development, of sociology as a discipline</p>

                     <p>In an article entitled ‘On the Cunning of Imperialist Reason’, Pierre Bourdieu and Loïc Wacquant (1999) refer to theorization as ‘the power to universalize particularisms linked to a singular historical tradition by causing them to be misrecognized as such’ (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1999, 41). In other words, theorization is understood as a form of neutralization of the historical context. In this, as in other pieces, Bourdieu showed reluctance to extract concepts – understood as structured structures – from the contexts of their production, or from their structuring structures (Robbins 1994). This, he thought, was a way of imposing (Western) sociological</p>
