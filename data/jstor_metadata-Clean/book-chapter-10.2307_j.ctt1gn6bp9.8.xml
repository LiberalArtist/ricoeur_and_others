         <p>For more than fifty years, Assia Djebar, former Silver Chair of French at New York University and winner of the Neustadt Prize for Contribution to World Literature, used the tools of poetry, fiction, drama and film to vividly portray the world of Muslim women in all its complexity. In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In<italic>Assia Djebar</italic>, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,<italic>Assia Djebar</italic>will be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.</p>

                        <italic>Assia Djebar: Out of Algeria</italic>is a book about expatriation, and the constant, necessary revisiting that follows. Algeria remains a focus, an object of desire throughout Djebar’s corpus, but it is also a point of departure, and excludes the writer more often than it grounds or defines her. Her only locus of identification or belonging, Algeria is at the same time figured as broken, war-torn, unfamiliar and irrevocably lost. A potential symbol of difference in contradistinction to colonial influence, Djebar’s Algeria is also diverse, divided and ultimately destroyed. Driven by the urge to recover her country’s history, Djebar repeatedly returns</p>

                     <p>Assia Djebar wrote four novels during the first phase of her career between 1957 and 1967. After leaving the Ecole normale supérieure at Sèvres during the war of independence, she worked for the national newspaper<italic>El moudjahid</italic>conducting interviews with Algerian refugees in Tunis and Morocco, before going on to teach history in Rabat and later in Algiers. The novels consist at this stage in a form of experimentation, and the period can be seen as one of apprenticeship in the strategies and techniques of writing. At times highly naive and a little self-indulgent, Djebar’s early novels set out to</p>

The reasons for this silence are evidently manifold and testify to the difficulties associated with locating and describing a position in the aftermath of the upheavals of the war. Having struggled to create a meaningful narrative reconstructing her characters’ experiences in the maquis in<italic>Les Alouettes</italic>, Djebar temporarily abandoned the use of written language as a means of making sense of colonial violence and instead experimented with film.

                     <p>The notion of womanhood or femininity occupies a fraught position in Djebar’s work. She is on the one hand clearly preoccupied with Algerian women’s particular experiences, narrating numerous scenes of female oppression and liberation occurring at different moments in the history of the country. She sets out to retrieve suppressed feminine voices as she reflects on the relation between women and writing, and on the importance of creating a sense of agency through self-expression. On the other hand, however, Djebar also unsettles the very category of femininity, dissociating herself from women’s writing movements and contesting the validity of any specified</p>

While<italic>Loin de Médine</italic>returns to the early days of Islam in order to denounce the misuse of the past by resurgent Islamists at the end of the 1980s, Djebar’s next group of texts focuses overtly and pointedly on the present. As the political climate in Algeria becomes steadily more fraught, reflections on femininity and genealogy are superseded by a direct engagement with current confrontations and losses, and Djebar’s horror at the upsurge of Islamist terrorism leads her to interrogate more pointedly the contemporary disintegration of her native land.

While<italic>Le Blanc de l’Algérie</italic>and<italic>Oran, langue morte</italic>begin a process of mourning and resuscitate the ghosts of some of Algeria’s writers, intellectuals and resistance fighters, the next two novels present that process of mourning as always, inevitably incomplete.

The lingering traces of a search for the specific in the earlier works give way, by the time of<italic>La Femme sans sépulture</italic>and<italic>La Disparition</italic>, to a depiction of Algeria’s culture, language and history as intractable or spectral – present but impossible to grasp.
