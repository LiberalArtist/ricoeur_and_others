         <p>The idea of the tragic has permeated Western culture for millennia, and has been expressed theatrically since the time of the ancient Greeks. However, it was in the Europe of the twentieth century – one of the most violent periods of human history – that the tragic form significantly developed. ‘Modern European Tragedy’ examines the consciousness of this era, drawing a picture of the development of the tragic through an in-depth analysis of some of the twentieth century’s most outstanding texts.</p>

                     <p>In a famous essay on the tragic in ancient drama as reflected in the tragic in modern drama, Søren Kierkegaard observed that ‘the tragic, after all, is always the tragic’ and that the idea of the tragic remains essentially the same, as it remains natural for mankind to weep.¹</p>
                     <p>The consciousness of the tragic has traversed Western culture for millennia. It is closely bound up with the intuition of inescapable limits, inseparable from the human condition, the ambiguity and contradictions of the human and the awareness of suffering. Perhaps it can be conjectured that awareness of the tragic is a</p>

                     <p>An entirely different outlook, profoundly influenced by faith in Christianity and inspired by the Gospels, appears in the dramatic development of the tragic awareness of another great writer of the early twentieth century, Paul Claudel.¹ We can choose<italic>The Tidings Brought to Mary</italic>to explore the theme we are concerned with here.</p>

                        <italic>Tidings</italic>is a key text in twentieth-century dramaturgy. The tragic inspiration, sifted through the religious idea of existence and expressed in the modes of high poetry, modulated in lyrical and liturgical patterns, develops into a positive vision.</p>

                     <p>It will hardly appear surprising that a selection of the key texts of European twentiethcentury drama should include a work by Eugene O’neill, being yet another response to the emergence of the twentieth century’s tragic consciousness. Of course he was American, but the matrix of his work is deeply rooted in European culture and theatrical research, with a pessimistic anthropology and a probing of behaviour based on depth psychology (one of the major axes of twentieth-century thought), embedded in a formal structure that is original and innovative compared to the currents of commercial Broadway theatre.¹</p>

                     <p>The form of tragedy and the traditional mode of expressing man’s tragic condition in the theatre were, as is well known, some of Bertolt Brecht’s most controversial targets.¹ There are two sets of reasons for this. The first is technical, because classical tragedy and the drama that derives from it belong, as Brecht saw it, to a kind of theatre that does not arouse the critical spirit and the dialectical attitude. The second is philosophical, because they are founded on an idea of destiny and the immutability or universality of human thought, in conflict with Brecht’s Marxian principles.²</p>

Hannah Arendt, writing to her husband from Paris, described him as ‘the best man in France’.

                     <p>The idea of the tragic is elaborated with great intellectual commitment and elevated poetry in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s writings for the stage. His work follows a distinctive and original path which we can rightly include in the map of fundamental twentieth-century developments in the genre.</p>
                     <p>In Pasolini it is not so much philosophical culture as literary (in this case ancient Greek drama) and anthropological culture that constitute the matrix of the work in consideration and provide the basic ideas with which the universal experiences of the limit and necessity are reinterpreted.¹ The tragic action is presented as an arrogant and</p>

                     <p>A radical transformation in the theatrical representation of the tragic occurred in the late twentieth century, beginning in the sixties and growing out of the performance scene and avant-garde experiments. It launched a new course of the “living art” that characterized the last decades of the century and pioneered performative theatre, the modern version of the<italic>ars una</italic>by which the current emergence of the tragic consciousness will have to be explored.</p>
                     <p>Jerzy Grotowski, whose work I now intend to explore, was the great teacher and founder of the Teatr Laboratorium. Grotowski presented to the audience’s vigilant consciousness the great</p>

                     <p>I close this study with a provisional epilogue, which offers a glimpse at tragic dramaturgy in the last decades of the century (to which I plan to devote a future study) within the radical renewal of Western theatre since the late sixties.</p>
                     <p>It takes the form of an advance on two fronts. The first is thematic, it is the subject of this book taken to its extreme, the greatest and undoubtedly the most hateful transgression of the limit in this century: genocide, of which we saw a memorable anticipation in Grotowski’s<italic>Akropolis</italic>.
