                     <p>Luc Boltanski is widely regarded as one of the most influential French sociologists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. He is one of the leading figures of the ‘pragmatic’ tradition within contemporary social and political thought. More specifically, he is – along with Laurent Thévenot – one of the founding figures of an approach that he himself characterizes as the ‘pragmatic sociology of critique’.</p>
                     <p>Boltanski was born in 1940. He is the brother of the artist Christian Boltanski and of the linguist Jean-Élie Boltanski. He studied social sciences at the University of Paris, La Sorbonne, and completed his<italic>Thèse</italic>

                     <p>All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat</p>

                     <p>Luc Boltanski, whose work is reaching a crescendo, has made an enduring contribution to sociology. His distinction lies chiefly in his inventive crossing of the approach to domination in the Marxist and Weberian traditions with the interest in moral and symbolic representations of the Durkheimian tradition. Yet, it also bears all the fascination of his early alliance with his master, Bourdieu, and his subsequent public break from him. In particular, we see the mature Boltanski wrestling productively with a fruitful conceptual framework for understanding the contemporary mode of production, and the reappearance within it of mass precariousness in relation to</p>

                     <p>Luc Boltanski’s sociology has been labelled ‘pragmatic’, and the author now uses this label to characterize his research endeavour.¹ What does this designation mean? In this chapter, we shall examine what exactly such a qualification is about, and we shall do so from a pragmatist point of view. Let us say straightaway that we do not see what is truly ‘pragmatic’ in Boltanski’s sociology.² From a pragmatist perspective, it appears as a continuation of the classical dualisms of European thought, and the critique it proposes seems to make the same mistakes as the wholesale generalizations of social theory.

                     <p>Is Luc Boltanski a pragmatist thinker? In some current French debates, this question is not a rhetorical one. More than ten years after Pierre Bourdieu’s death, and about thirty years after the founding of the Groupe de Sociologie Politique et Morale (GSPM) with Laurent Thévenot and Michael Pollak at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, the critical stance towards Bourdieusian sociology seems to be increasingly linked to the question of whether or not one may be described as a pragmatist.</p>

                     <p>In 1987, a theoretical book that had been co-written by the sociologist Luc Boltanski and the economist and statistician Laurent Thévenot appeared in an obscure, poorly distributed collection of the Presses Universitaires de France. At first sight, its title may have sounded rather strange:<italic>Les économies de la grandeur (Economies of Worth</italic>). What was even more disconcerting, however, was the apparent disproportion between the ordinariness of the main issues in question (that is, disputing processes in the workplace, the family, the neighbourhood, etc.) and the ambitious nature of the theoretical framework. In fact, the authors put forward a whole set</p>

The programme promised to break a deadlock in theoretical debate and open new avenues in key areas of sociological inquiry, not least historical and comparative sociology. Today, in my view, some of the potential has in fact been realized, but the renewal in social theory that should have been expected to follow has not, or hardly,</p>

                     <p>The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself. The debates in the social sciences during this period significantly turned around</p>

                     <p>As a sociologist working in the emerging area of the sociology of human rights, I find the approach that Luc Boltanski and his various collaborators take to cultural, moral, and political questions inspiring. There is an urgent need to develop theoretical concepts and methodologies to study human rights, which have been growing in importance as a result of the activities of transnational advocacy networks, digital communication, and the codification and enactment of international law since the end of the Cold War (see Nash, 2012). What resources do human rights offer for the critique of injustices? Are human rights contributing to</p>

In this chapter, I shall make the political dimension in French pragmatic sociology more explicit and shall explore a tendency to ‘politicization’ of pragmatic sociology in some more recent works of Luc Boltanski. This is done with an eye to what I see as a normative dimension in pragmatic sociology that links it with (radical)</p>

The chapter discusses problematic implications of European integration, such as the notion that some form of European state may emerge or that the ‘evercloser union’ – one of the EU’s ambitions – implies the creation of European citizenship and parallel forms of identity and class allegiances to those found in traditional nation-states.

                     <p>One persistent theoretical and practical problem in Marxism was to explain the failures of working-class opposition to capitalist exploitation. Karl Marx had assumed that the organized working class would eventually engage in a successful political struggle against the ruling class alongside a background of systematic crises in the economic system. A wide range of explanations as to why this transformation did not take place has been developed over the decades after Marx’s death in 1883. At the end of the nineteenth century, it appeared that the condition of the German working class had improved, suggesting that capitalism could be reformed.</p>

More exactly, it means understanding abortion as a certain position in the problem opened up by procreation, as twofold natural and social processes: production of the living by the living, reproduction in the biological sense,</p>

Although the six polities, or ‘worlds of worth’, that they present derive value from quite different sources, each world is subject to the same general accounting principles, such that one can compare how the worlds allocate costs and benefits to sustain their respective conceptions of value. Indeed, the very possibility of critique appears to require this capacity. (I shall return to this point below.) The general principles behind the polities are simple but clever:</p>

                     <p>This chapter is concerned with issues of temporality and the programme of pragmatic sociology. It outlines a problem of time operating within this programme. This problem is identified as concerning the location of social change and the new as external to situations and events, a positioning which, I will argue, eschews the<italic>indeterminacy</italic>and<italic>openness</italic>of the contemporary world. I suggest further that such a positioning of the new also cannot come to grips with forms of critique that have no time, or, better said, forms of critique that have run out of time or are dispossessed of time and,</p>

                     <p>The discipline of sociology partly originated from a perception of the limitations of political philosophy. The transition to modernity demanded new ways of addressing the questions that political philosophy had typically posed, such as the nature of authority, the conditions of the good life, the definition of justice, the degrees of freedom, and the prerequisites of inclusion in a community. Classical sociological theory reflected the modern appreciation of the independence of ‘the social’ relative to ‘the political’ and the need to understand the internal dynamics of ‘the social’ in their own terms. In a stronger sense, sociological theory suggested that</p>

I am interested in how this relationship has changed, particularly over the last thirty years; I think that there may have been a significant change in this relationship. Before this period, there was the idea that social theory, or sociology, was somehow taking over questions of political philosophy and that political philosophy was even being superseded by approaches informed by the social sciences. Yet, over the course of the last thirty years or more that</p>

                     <p>The ‘sociology of critique’ and ‘critical theory’ offer different perspectives on the phenomenon of critique. The former approach has been developed by Luc Boltanski, as well as by other members of the Groupe de Sociologie Politique et Morale (GSPM), with the aim of providing an alternative to Pierre Bourdieu’s ‘critical sociology’. The latter approach has been developed further by Axel Honneth, who proposes a ‘theory of recognition’, and whose work descends from the tradition of the Frankfurt School. Is critique, first and foremost, an achievement of ‘ordinary’ actors or a task of theory? What is the relationship between theory and</p>

                     <p>Luc Boltanski is a sociologist and Directeur d’études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. Born in 1940, he is the author of 15 books, which are based on various field studies and transcend disciplinary boundaries: nursing, reproduction, abortion, the professional world of cadres, humanitarian issues, and management – to mention only a few of the topics covered in his works. His sociology focuses on the analysis of normative orders and resources mobilized by human actors in order to preserve, or challenge, particular sets of social arrangements. As reflected in the debates sparked by his ‘pragmatic turn’, the conceptual</p>

As indicated in the title of her piece, ‘Figures of Descent from Classical Sociological Theory: Luc Boltanski’,¹ Fowler examines Boltanski’s writings in relation to classical sociological thought. In so doing, she suggests that his critical engagement with mechanisms of</p>
