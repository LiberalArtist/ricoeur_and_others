                     <p>This third volume of<italic>Irish Cultural Memory</italic>sets out to focus on two periods that form what I call “memory cruxes” within the broader memory bank of Irish cultural experience. In an obvious way, just as there are particular moments that stand out in the individual memory over time, there are also moments that can be identified as particularly important in the cultural memory of a group. These might be historical events deemed to be retrospectively important for ushering in a new era, or a period of heightened change; particular individuals can become emblematic of a given time or connected</p>

                     <p>The problem is, surely, how to address redress with adequate justice. Redress assumes, not a saving intervention that might prevent acts of violence and expropriation in the present, but an address to the past from which we are disjoined by the very history of which effective violence is a constitutive part. In relation to the violence of the past, we seem helpless, impotent to set right the injustice that has so forcefully shaped the very times that we inhabit. Suspended between the call to vengeance and the commitment to memory, redress is charged neither with the repetition of the cycles</p>

                     <p>In the fall of 1920, daily newspapers around the world told the story of the starvation of a man. The death of Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork, on October 25, 1920, the seventy-fourth day of his hunger strike in England’s Brixton prison, spurred an unprecedented level of collective mourning in the Irish diaspora; as such, it remains a unique event in Irish and Irish American history. More than a million people, in Ireland and around the world, gathered on streets, in churches, and in stadiums to mourn the famished body of this republican mayor. These gatherings supported the</p>

                     <p>“Irish anniversaries,” according to historian Ian McBride, “have an uncanny way of making history themselves” (McBride 2001, 304). Introducing a collection of essays entitled<italic>History and Memory in Modern Ireland</italic>, McBride observes, “In Ireland, as is well known, the interpretation of the past has always been at the heart of national conflict … What is so striking about the Irish case is not simply the tendency for present conflicts to express themselves through the personalities of the past, but the way in which commemorative rituals have become historical forces in their own right” (ibid., 1–2).

                     <p>The question “Why are there no photographs of the Famine?” appears, at the outset, to be one easily answered. With photography in its infancy in Ireland (invented only in 1839 and in limited practice by the mid-1840s, primarily by wealthy Anglo-Irish hobbyists and a small handful of enthusiasts and budding entrepreneurs¹), very few of the extant images dating to the Famine period deal in any way with social subjects, and no contemporaneous image of the Famine has been identified.² Yet there are several reasons why photography’s relationship to the Famine persists in significance despite this historical absence.

When a manuscript begins with the words “<italic>In Illo tempore</italic>,” “In the Old days,” “<italic>Fado Fado</italic>,” one is already encountering a particular narrative take on the legacy of the past.

                     <p>Emblematic of a dark period in a troubled colonization, the workhouse is a dirty word in Irish history. Its system, buildings, and sites comprise a challenging representational struggle between erasure and reconstruction in remembrance. Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have</p>

                     <p>Trauma theory made its debut in Irish studies during the sesquicentennial commemoration of the Great Famine (1846–49). A critical genealogy of this intervention will help to clarify the potential, the limitations, the dangers, and above all the ideological stakes and motives of this recent addition to the arsenal of nationalist historiography and cultural analysis.</p>
                     <p>Among the most terrible catastrophes on modern European record, the Great Famine self-evidently qualifies as a massive collective trauma in the popular sense. But the spate of anniversary reflections also encouraged a reading of the Famine as traumatic in the psychotherapeutic sense, that is, as</p>

                     <p>Since the 1994 paramilitary ceasefires, the Irish peace process has stimulated a flowering of practices of history-making, remembrance, and commemoration concerned with the legacy of the Troubles in “post-conflict” Northern Ireland.¹ Much of this work has taken the form of oral-history and life-history narrative that enables personal reflection on the significance of violent conflict in the recent past and reassessment of its impact upon individuals, families, and local areas. Such memory-work has intersected with wider public debate over, and engagement with, the question of the victims of violence, including the formation of numbers of local victims’ support groups addressing the</p>

The word that sparks this essay is “retained” rather than the inherently grander claims of Brodsky’s statement, claims that one can only fully understand and relate to the traditions of Russian poetry, instead of the slightly more moderate preoccupations of contemporary poetry in English. For “retained” read “memory,” the bulwark of the individual mind, or poetic imagination, in the act</p>

                     <p>The past is always present in Northern Ireland, structuring everyday experience to a degree not generally found elsewhere. In a society where historical events are continually relevant to contemporary life, both cultural memory and processes of memorialization become significant means whereby people live out their identities. In turn, this level of awareness also informs aspects of the visual: artists are not separate from the culture they inhabit but are equally formed by its shared experiences of community, danger, and loss. Much of the work of artists in post-conflict Northern Ireland bears the marks of this communality of experience, whether through</p>

Field Day’s mission was “to contribute to the solution of the present crisis by producing analysis of the established opinions, myths and stereotypes which had become both a symptom and a cause of the current situation” (Deane 1985b, blurb).

However, if Stephen’s consciousness of the nightmare denotes a degree of agency and alludes to the potential for emancipation through awakening, Leerssen’s description evokes the feeling of utter powerlessness symptomatic of trauma (see Herman</p>

On July 1, the Battle of the Somme, 1916, is remembered through parades, church services, and wreath-laying ceremonies, and eleven days later, on July twelfth, the Battle of the Boyne, 1690, is remembered through more parades, bonfires, church services, and political speeches held at “the field,” the destination of the parades. This is the height of the “marching season,” with streets festooned with loyal flags and bunting; commemorative Orange</p>

The attention given to political or paramilitary commemoration reflects the fact that Republican and Loyalist commemoration extends beyond mourning, and into the projection of overtly political messages and charged communal narratives via the media of ritual display and highly graphic murals.
