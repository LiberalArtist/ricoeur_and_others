                     <p>At the beginning of chapter 25, we witness the following scene, in which an idea is bodied forth:</p>
                     <p>. . . the mob, who, indignant at being excluded, and<italic>anxious</italic>to see what followed, relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell, for an hour or two afterwards. In this amusement they all took part by turns, except three or four fortunate individuals, who having discovered a grating in the gate which commanded<italic>a view of nothing,</italic>were<italic>staring</italic>through it, with the same indefatigable perseverance with which people will flatten their noses against the front</p>

                     <p>That prosopopoeic synecdoche for spectral legions of amateur researchers of independent means, the “elderly gentleman of scientific attainments” with whom we concluded the previous chapter, is associated with light and with illumination, in several ways. The first association has to do with literal light. As we have seen, the empirical fact of its appearance is separated from the misinterpretation that arises from it. This separation leads to a moment of epistemological enlightenment, however dubious or risible this may appear to the reader through the focus offered by Boz. This in turn survives beyond the event to become a scientific “paper”</p>

                     <p>In focusing throughout this study on the odd, insistent recurrence of figures of sight, vision, visualization, and so on in Pickwick, I have situated a series of questions that arise in part from a struggle with determination similar to that expressed by Raymond Williams in the second of my three epigraphs (1983, 160–61), fragments of which have already surfaced in previous chapters. Though already asked, and in part answered, they should now be restated. Why do these motifs, figures, metaphors, and forms of seeing occur and recur, and why do they keep coming and going, taking place in that</p>
