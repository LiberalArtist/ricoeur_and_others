      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).</p>

In a practical sense, these essays emerged from the 2008 annual symposium of the Royal Society of Canada; in a creative sense, they represent a selection of responses to issues surrounding war and peace as these activities are perceived – and challenged – by scholars in the humanities and by artists. The 2008 symposium, called “The Cultures of War and Peace/Les cultures de la guerre et de la paix,” was organized by Academy I of the RSC, the Academy devoted to Arts and Humanities, and the theme was chosen both for its urgent</p>

The decision to create this series arose from a belief that the majority of Americans were not fully aware of the philosophical issues involved in the war; they needed to be convinced of the dangers of isolationism and the necessity of joining the crusade against fascism.

                     <p>The horrors of war and the longing for peace cannot be fully expressed in words: music has the capacity both to evoke deep emotion in individuals and to meld these individual responses into a communal expression, providing a channel for the sharing of intentions, a “human technology for crossing the solipsistic gulf.”¹ It was fitting, therefore, for music to be part of a symposium on <italic>The Cultures of War and Peace</italic>, voicing the call for a culture of peace.</p>
                     <p>In early November 2007, I was commissioned to write a new string quartet for the 2008 Royal Society of Canada Academy</p>
