         <p>New from the Bible and Women Series</p>
         <p>This collection of essays deals with aspects of women and gender relations in early Judaism (during the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires). Some essays focus on specific writings: the Greek (Septuagint) version of Esther, Judith, Joseph and Aseneth, and the Letter of Jeremiah. Others explore how certain biblical texts are reinterpreted: Eve in the Life of Adam and Eve, the mixing of the sons of God with the daughters of men from Genesis 6:1-4, the Egyptian princess at the birth of Moses, and how Josephus retells biblical stories. The third group of essays explore specific social contexts: Philo's views of women in the Roman empire, the Sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls, and women philosophers of the Therapeutae in Egyptian Alexandria.</p>

         <p>An International team of contributors from Europe and North AmericaA breadth of materials covered, including many lesser-known early Jewish writingsFocus is on a gendered perspective and gender specific questions</p>

                     <p>The Greek Book of Esther is one of several early Jewish novels that feature female protagonists who prevail over the machinations of men to save themselves and their people.¹ In contrast to Judith and other early Jewish writings, Greek Esther has a counterpart in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible (MT) and has two major versions, generally known as LXX Esther and the Alpha Text. The present discussion will be based on the LXX version of Greek Esther on the grounds that it is this version that became more widespread and influential due to its inclusion in the Sseptuagint.²</p>

                     <p>“No other woman from one end of the earth to the other looks so beautiful or speaks so wisely!” (Jdt 11:21 NRSV)—such is how the soldiers in the Assyrian camp marvel as they look at Judith. They marvel above all at her beauty.</p>
                     <p>The focus in the following contribution will be on the portrait of Judith as presented in the Septuagint; one of the central concerns of this version is the beauty of Judith. In order to describe the portrait of Judith, the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek version of approximately 100 BCE, will first be analyzed and then compared</p>

                     <p>In Gen 41:45, Joseph receives from Pharaoh, in gratitude for interpreting Pharaoh’s dreams, Aseneth (Aσενέθ; Hebrew: תנסא: Asenath/Osnath), daughter of Pentephres (Hebrew: Potiphera), priest of Heliopolis (Hebrew: On) as his wife. She gives birth to two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, ancestors of two of the later tribes of Israel (Gen 42:50; 46:20). In the Bible this is only a marginal note. But postbiblical narrators expand on this scant information to create a romantic adventure story that today is called Joseph and Aseneth (Jos. Asen.).¹</p>

                     <p>The figures of Adam and Eve both frequently appear in early Jewish writings from Hellenistic-Roman times but with different significance and characteristics. While Adam emerges in numerous passages (2 En. 30–32; 42; 58; 4 Ezra 3.4–27; 4.30–32; 7; 2 Bar. 4.17–19; 23; 48.42–50; 54; 56; 3 Bar. 9; sib. or. 3.24–28; apoc. sedr. 4–8), Eve appears mainly in association with her companion (Jub. 2–4; 1 En. 32; 2 En. 31; 2 Bar. 48.42–43; apoc. ab. 23–24; 3 Bar. 4; apoc.

                     <p>The mythical theme of sexual union between heavenly beings and earthly beings, especially with humans, is found in many cultures. When these stories involve heterosexual intercourse, it is usually the offspring of such intercourse that are of interest. The narrative function of these stories of sexual union can vary widely. Often the stories are explanations for unusual physical strength, the heroic make up of one or more of the protagonists. The superhuman is explained by its genesis. in the Bible this mythical theme is barely visible.¹ When a text such as Ps 2:7, for example, states of the king that</p>

                     <p>In her essay “Women of Exodus in Biblical Retellings of the Second Temple Period,” Eileen Schuller points out how ancient Jewish literature rarely refers to women as frequently as it does in the first chapters of Exodus.¹ These chapters introduce us to the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah (Exod 1:15); Moses’s wife Zipporah (Exod 2:21; 4:25–26; 18:2); Amram’s wife Jochebed, the mother of Moses, Aaron, and Miriam (Exod 6:20);² Aaron’s wife Elisheba (Exod 6:23); and Miriam (Exod 15: 20–21). More women are referred to anonymously: Exod 2 refers to “a Levite woman” (יול תב, v. 1),³ the anonymous</p>

                     <p>Scholars with a feminist awareness have often been intrigued by Philo of Alexandria, who stands at one of the most important watersheds of Western civilization, namely, at the juncture between Judaism and Hellenism in the first century CE, just before Christianity emerged and adopted many of his ideas. Philo’s views of women have regularly been seen as uniformly negative. The only open question has pertained to the origin of his views, whether they derived from Jewish or Greek sources.¹ In this context an important factor has regularly been overlooked, namely, Philo’s dramatic intellectual development as a result of his visit</p>

                     <p>The religious world represented in the sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls is one that assumes distinctive roles for women and men, as well as very particular understandings of acceptable gender dynamics and sexual norms. a feminist critical reading of these texts “against the grain,” however, reveals some surprising possibilities for women’s presence, participation, and authority in the communities associated with these texts. Such a reading also reveals significant dynamics of contestation around these social roles. awareness of the apparent power dynamics in the sectarian scrolls suggests that readers must be cautious in making historical claims with regard to the textual evidence.</p>
