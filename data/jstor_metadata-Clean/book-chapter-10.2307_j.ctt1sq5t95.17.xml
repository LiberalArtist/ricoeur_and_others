         <p>What has contemporary China inherited from its revolutionary past? How do the realities and memories, aesthetics and practices of the Mao era still reverberate in the post-Mao cultural landscape? The essays in this volume propose “red legacies" as a new critical framework from which to examine the profusion of cultural productions and afterlives of the communist revolution in order to understand China’s continuities and transformations from socialism to postsocialism. Organized into five parts—red foundations, red icons, red classics, red bodies, and red shadows—the book’s interdisciplinary contributions focus on visual and performing arts, literature and film, language and thought, architecture, museums, and memorials. Mediating at once unfulfilled ideals and unmourned ghosts across generations, red cultural legacies suggest both inheritance and debt, and can be mobilized to support as well as to critique the status quo.</p>

                     <p>In July 1976, the monthly periodical<italic>People’s Liberation Army Pictorial</italic>published a four-page photo spread depicting soldiers visiting the historic sites of the Chinese Communist Revolution. Beginning with the site of the First Party Congress in Shanghai (<italic>yida huizhi</italic>一大会址) and ending with Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the eight photographs gave readers a virtual tour of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history. Designed to celebrate the party’s July anniversary, the images were paired with eight poems in the format of a traditional tourist’s itinerary of eight vistas. Yet this kind of tour was different: the eight places were official revolutionary sites,</p>

                     <p>Posters of China’s Cultural Revolution occupy a prominent but paradoxical place in the memory and imaginary of Mao’s China; they elicit complex and contradictory responses among diverse audiences, Chinese and global. Some, particularly those who experienced the political persecution and physical violence of the era, see them as unwelcome reminders of an oppressive and brutal regime. For others, they recall lost dreams of youth, and yearnings for a socialist future of justice and equality.¹ For yet others, they represent the imagined certainties of a past structured by order and stability.

                     <p>This chapter examines three “grand revolutionary music and dance epics” (<italic>daxing geming yinyue wudao shishi</italic>大型革命音乐舞蹈史诗) created and performed from 1964 to 2009. Placing the first,<italic>The East Is Red</italic>(<italic>Dongfang hong</italic>东方红), in the broader context of the international socialist movement, one can see it as dramatizing Mao Zedong’s concern with the possibility that China might undergo a peaceful evolution from socialism to capitalism, an idea that emerged as a result of Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin in 1956. Mao’s rebuttal to Khrushchev’s revisionist theories—which foresaw, for example, “peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the Western capitalist world, and</p>

                     <p>Amid a mixture of euphoria and controversy, the Chinese writer Mo Yan 莫言 (1955–) was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. Readers and critics in Chinese and Sinophone communities welcomed the news because since the mid-1980s, Mo Yan has proven to be a most eloquent and poignant storyteller of modern Chinese history, a writer, in the words of the Nobel Prize Committee, “who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary.”¹ The Chinese government took Mo Yan’s honor most favorably, treating it as a belated recognition of Chinese socialist literature at its finest.

The scene brings to the fore two notable aspects of Chinese socialist realist cinema: its melodramatic romanticism and its propensity to indulge in formalist techniques during moments of maximum emotional and ideological impact.¹ In this scene, editing is particularly foregrounded; the seven shots preceding the explosion take approximately sixteen seconds in all, for a quick editing rate of just over</p>

Years later, soon after Mao’s death, the now grown-up son is whisked to the capital to be trained as Mao’s impersonator. As such, he becomes his hometown’s pride and joy. But when the</p>

                     <p>Under the creative direction of master filmmaker Zhang Yimou 张艺谋, the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games Opening Ceremony drew on China’s rich cultural resources and seemingly unlimited assets in capital and manpower to exhibit an unprecedented visual and technological extravaganza. Though it won high praise and commendations for its spectacular achievement, the huge crowd formations that structured the narrative of the exhibition unsettled many observers. Zhang’s use of such “human wave tactics” (<italic>renhai zhanshu</italic>人海战术) not only partakes of the global imaginary of masses and multitudes made emblematic during the twentieth century’s “era of crowds” but also evokes the powerful and</p>

                     <p>This chapter discusses a few areas in which I believe we can find traces of the abiding, and beguiling, heritage of the Maoist era and state socialism in today’s China.¹ In a number of interconnected spheres, a nuanced understanding of what have been called “red legacies” in China, as well as more broadly, can continue to enliven discussions of contemporary history, thought, culture, and politics. In the following I will focus on recent events before offering, in turn, some observations on history, the Maoist legacy, and academic engagement with the People’s Republic.</p>
