         <p>Throughout Europe, standardised approaches to social policy and practice are being radically questioned and modified. Beginning from the narrative detail of individual lives, this book re-thinks welfare predicaments, emphasising gender, generation, ethnic and class implications of economic and social deregulation.Based on 250 life-story interviews in seven European Union countries, Biography and social exclusion in Europe: analyses personal struggles against social exclusion to illuminate local milieus and changing welfare regimes and contexts; points to challenging new agendas for European politics and welfare, beyond the rhetoric of communitarianism and the New Deal; vividly illustrates the lived experience and environmental complexity working for and against structural processes of social exclusion; refashions the interpretive tradition as a teaching and research tool linking macro and micro realities. · · Students, academic teachers and professional trainers, practitioners, politicians, policy makers and researchers in applied and comparative welfare fields will all benefit from reading this book.</p>

                     <p>This book describes the life experiences of individuals in contemporary Europe whose lives have been marked by one or more forms of ‘social exclusion’, as this term has come to be used over the past decade or so (Askonas and Stewart, 2000; Levitas 1998). We try to make meaningful such experiences as being made redundant, being blocked in a career, leaving school without qualifications, finding a place as a migrant in a European country, or bringing up children as a ‘single parent’. These were among the life contingencies that had originally led to individuals being selected for our study sample</p>

                     <p>The research work carried out by Sostris was based on the shared assumption that our subjects were active and resourceful individuals dealing with all kinds of challenges. This chapter puts this basic assumption to the test. Nicolás from Catalonia and Heike from eastern Germany, two well-educated young adults who, geographically speaking, happen to live at opposite ends of the EU, have both come to a dead end in their life journeys – a ‘biographical blockage’. Although we found it demanding enough to try to understand the processes that brought these two young people to this point, we also wanted to</p>

                     <p>The chapter demonstrates how the life experiences of a small number of individuals can illuminate an important dimension of British social structure. Its particular focus is an ever-present aspect of British society – class¹. The meaning and effects of class are seen through the prism of four people’s experience of enforced redundancy or early retirement during the early 1990s. Two of our subjects belonged to what would normally be described as industrial working-class occupations – both were coal miners. One had worked on the coalface, the other was a craftsman engineer, engaged in maintenance work underground. Their stories show that</p>

                     <p>Readers of Robert Roberts’ famous book,<italic>The classic slum</italic>, will remember a photograph showing men standing at the doorstep of a pub, with the legend: “The shortest way out of Manchester”. What these men wish to escape by drinking is not work in itself, the book relates, but the combination of low wages, exhaustion and awful working conditions, together with miseries in everyday life, such as terrible housing, shortage of food, illness, and all the outcomes of these at the levels of public and private life, privacy and intimacy. These men want to escape from their life as a whole,</p>

                     <p>The notion of Ithaki for most men and women has been historically and socially differentiated, the result of socially determined gender expectations and personal and social constraints. Men’s journeys in this century have typically been associated with their lives outside the home and at work (Seccombe, 1986). However, the social and economic changes of the past three decades have made many men feel that the journey to the island is no longer a well-charted one. Journeys in modern capitalist states have become increasingly uncertain. They depend on the ability of the individual to negotiate the Scylla and Charybdis1 of unemployment,</p>

                     <p>In this chapter, women’s identities are conceptualised in terms of two poles – love and emancipation. In the Sostris case studies of women from varied backgrounds, these polarities were frequently seen to interact in the women’s lives, to the point of cross-fertilisation, leading to new orientations. We have chosen the cases of three women whose circumstances are in some respects strikingly similar and in others notably different. Together these cases indicate new patterns in contemporary European societies: the crossing of cultural, social and geographical borders, as well as the growing importance of emancipation for providing a sense of security relative</p>

                     <p>The condition of women has undergone impressive changes since the late 1960s. A series of interconnected changes have made possible a new way of being a woman: the new consumer culture, television, the technological transformation of domestic activities, mass schooling, the new youth culture, the political and cultural environment around 1968, and the feminist struggle that brought abortion, contraception and divorce to the forefront of public debate.</p>
                     <p>Such processes have produced multiple consequences, from a tendency to more equal sharing of domestic commitments to a decline in the fertility rate. If we were to select the most innovative feature, however,</p>

There are clear indications that aspects of family life are altering. These include the later age of marriage¹, increasing rates of divorce², the increase in female participation in the paid labour force³, and the very slow increase in single parenthood⁴. Other new phenomena indirectly relating to family life, such as increased drug and alcohol use, and homelessness among young</p>

                     <p>This chapter reviews a period of tumultuous structural change and new sociocultural conditions in Sweden. It begins with the paradigmatic shift of the 1980s away from the Keynesian–corporatist–Fordist epoch and looks at the reinvention of the notion of the not-for-profit ‘social economy’ sector in a Swedish context. Through several cases of different immigrant groups and the ‘host’ population, the chapter explores the relevance and applicability of these changes for individuals at risk.</p>
                     <p>The cases portray some dramatic shifts in Swedish history. The lives of some began between the 1950s and 1970s, when both society and the workplace appeared</p>

                     <p>More and more people share the experience of migration, in the sense of crossing nation-state borders to start a new life in a different society. Theories of globalisation and postmodernism present this experience as a typical occurrence, almost taken for granted, in the lives of growing numbers of people. Even though migration constitutes the ‘normality’ of many societies to a greater or lesser degree, the public and, not least, the sociopolitical discourses of migration, are still predominantly shaped by the view that the large-scale movement of people somehow constitutes a problem. In the first place, the ‘problem’ of migration within</p>

What has been the impact on Djamillah’s life and identity of that ‘misrecognition’ of her brown skin as ‘dirty’? How did this event affect the children doing the excluding, and the teacher standing by? How widespread were such experiences in the 1970s, in Britain and in other countries, and for Black, Asian and Arab immigrants? How do schools tackle such incidents? In what ways does racialised social exclusion differ from other kinds of everyday social prejudice?</p>

                     <p>This volume’s introduction asked how we can come to understand the complex and rapidly changing societies of today, and what such new understanding implies for social policy. Now, from the thick texture of the case studies, we can draw together some more general conclusions concerning emergent gender, class, intercultural and intergenerational relations. We can ask more grounded questions:</p>
                     <p>What the biographies imply for the future of the European project.</p>
                     <p>What they suggest about the ‘nature of the epoch’ at the turn of the millennium.</p>
                     <p>How biographical methods might contribute to a movement for change within (comparative) social policy.</p>
                     <p>We invite</p>
