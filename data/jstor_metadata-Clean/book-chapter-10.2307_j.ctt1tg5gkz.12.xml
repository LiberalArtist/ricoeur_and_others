         <p>This second edition of Dru Gladney’s critically acclaimed study of the Muslim population in China includes a new preface by the author, as well as a valuable addendum to the bibliography, already hailed as one of the most extensive listing of modern sources on the Sino-Muslims. China's ten million Hui are one of the Muslim national minorities recognized by the Chinese government. Dru Gladney's fieldwork among these people has enabled him to identify diverse patterns of interaction between their rising nationalism and state policy.</p>

Starting at the Central Institute for Nationalities, the state-sponsored college that attempts to “educate” some of the most elite representatives of China’s 91 million minority nationalities, the protest began with mainly Hui Muslim students who were joined by representatives of all 10 Muslim nationalities in</p>

                     <p>The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem</p>

                     <p>The Hui are China’s most urbanized minority nationality. They constitute the vast majority of minorities in every Chinese city, with the exception of cities in the border regions of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. The ethnic identity of these urban Hui and the expression of that identity, however, is different from the northwestern Hui Muslim communities and the dispersed southeastern Hui lineages in many aspects. The issues and concerns facing these Hui as they seek to continue to adapt to changing urban life are well illustrated by the following conversation with a Hui cook at a small<italic>qing zhen</italic>restaurant</p>

Representatives from each of the four communities I have described in the preceding chapters may actually have come together in the protest march through the streets of Beijing. There were certainly a wide mixture of Muslims represented: Hui, Uigur, Kazak, and Kirghiz, all crying out for justice,</p>
