      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Why has literature in Western culture so often been called on to defend itself? How do defenses of fiction-making by poets and critics compete with the texts in which philosophers, theologians, historians, or scientists justify the truth-claims of their own disciplines? Margaret Ferguson addresses these questions in a wide-ranging study that defines and illuminates the defense as a rhetorical genre in its own right-a hybrid that blurs the boundary between fiction and theoretical explanation.</p>

                     <p>Jowett’s legendary advice to Oxford students embarking on careers in the British Empire may seem an odd epigraph for a book on defenses of poetry.¹ One of my purposes in writing this book, however, is to question the ideological presuppositions which underlie Jowett’s aphorism. By exploring a general territory of defensive discourse through readings of exemplary Renaissance texts, 1 hope, moreover, to suggest some reasons why Jowett’s rule has historically been honored more in the breach than in the observance, not only by poets and critics, but also by theologians, historians, scientists, and diplomats.</p>

Critics from the Florentine Accademia della Crusca had violently attacked the<italic>Gerusalemme Liberata</italic>, arguing that it was inferior in style and content to Ariosto’s<italic>Orlando Furioso</italic>.¹ To defend himself, Tasso had to prove the superiority of his Christian epic to Ariosto’s poem, which was, in Tasso’s view, ethically and aesthetically confused, an “animal of uncertain nature.”² Basically, Tasso defines the difference between his and Ariosto’s poems in terms of a</p>

                     <p>In 1586, a year after Tasso wrote his<italic>Apologia</italic>, Sir Philip Sidney died of a wound he received while fighting for the Protestant cause in the Netherlands. He left unfinished the revision of his<italic>Arcadia</italic>, a prose romance which concludes, in its original version, with a dramatic scene of trial. Like many of his readers, Sidney was evidently unsatisfied with the resolution of that trial: a father condemns his son and nephew to death for their crimes of passion, but the sentence is miraculously suspended when a supposedly dead king revives and pardons the princes.

                     <p>Tue prospect of ending a piece of work, like the prospect of beginning one, so frequently generates defensive discourse that one is led to speculate, a bit nostalgically, about the medieval convention of the retraction. As a version of the Augustinian confession, with its drama of a conversion from secular words to sacred ones, the retraction served psychological and aesthetic, as well as religious, aims by providing a formal channel for the apologetic impulse that perennially besets authors preparing to take leave of their books.¹ Although the retraction may seem a dead convention today, its ghost lives on in the</p>
