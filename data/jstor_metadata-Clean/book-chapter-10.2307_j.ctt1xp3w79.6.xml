         <p>The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world. Over the last five decades, women religious have engaged with the council’s reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeding the expectations of the Church. Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

                     <p>The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the closure of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). The council, which broadly aimed at aligning the Church with the modern world, is considered the most significant event in the history of contemporary Roman Catholicism. The impact of the council on women religious, who engaged with the reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeded the changes expected by the hierarchy of the Church. The decline of religious life is often blamed on the Second Vatican Council, but this book documents and demonstrates the greater complexity of the issues involved.</p>

                     <p>In Canada in the 1960s and 1970s, Roman Catholic congregations of women religious (commonly called nuns) suffered a perfect storm. External social forces such as secularism, feminism, consumerism, the sexual revolution, expanding state initiatives in social welfare, and the Cold War seemed to be attacking them from without by questioning their relevance. The Second Vatican Council (1962–65), called in part to address the Church’s response to these forces, initiated a period of profound self-questioning of women religious’ customs, ministries, governance, and even dress. The often divisive congregational debates associated with the Vatican II era were sometimes perceived by women</p>

The foundation was Langevin’s practical way of expressing his commitment to a culturally dual French-English vision of Canada, and of addressing his fears of Anglicization, which were heightened after the Manitoba government withdrew financial support for confessional schools in 1890. It was also a way to respond to the needs of the Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate in relation to the process of colonization of the Aboriginal peoples, mainly through</p>

                     <p>On 21 November 2014, Pope Francis issued an apostolic letter in which he proclaimed a “Year of Consecrated Life.” Writing to the members of the worldwide communities of men and women religious, he quoted the words of his predecessor, Pope Saint John Paul II, to indicate the year’s purpose: “You have not only a glorious history to remember and to recount, but also a great history still to be accomplished! Look to the future, where the Spirit is sending you, in order to do even greater things.”¹</p>

                     <p>This book focuses on women congregations’ encounter with modernity during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These three decades represent an era when social contentions revealed that paradigms no longer held and that new responses to both historical and emerging problems were required. The Western world was entering postmodernity, characterized by its fractured and liquid quality,¹ aptly characterized as an age of fracture, with the construct of woman being profoundly affected. A notion of identity common to all women was quickly problematized to a conception of womanhood that disaggregated along lines of race, gender, and sexuality. At the same time, the</p>
