         <p>Caputo's book is riveting.... A singular achievement of stylistic brio and impeccable scholarship, it breaks new ground in making a powerful case for treating Derrida as homo religiosis.... There can be no mistaking the importance of Caputo's work." -Edith Wyschogrod</p>
         <p>No one interested in Derrida, in Caputo, or in the larger question of postmodernism and religion can afford to ignore this pathbreaking study. Taking full advantage of the most recent and least discussed writings of Derrida, it offers a careful and comprehensive account of the religious dimension of Derrida's thought." -Merold Westphal</p>

                     <p>In his notebooks of 1976, Jacques Derrida proposes to hirnself the task of describing his broken covenant with Judaism in a work that would “leave nothing, if possible, in the dark of what related me to Judaism, alliance [<italic>alliance</italic>, covenant; Hebrew:<italic>Berit</italic>] broken in every respect” (<italic>Circon</italic>., 145/<italic>Circum</italic>., 154). For Derrida is Jewish without being Jewish, Jewish<italic>sans</italic>Judaism, married outside Judaism, his sons uncircumcised, he an atheist. Of this broken covenant, this breach of an<italic>alliance</italic>that stretches “throughout thousands of years of Judaism,” he says—now the time has changed to 1989 and this note has been stitched</p>

                     <p>The messianic tone of deconstruction was not at all evident at the start. Instead, in the midst of what looked more like a certain Nietzschean tone recently adopted in French philosophy in the 1960s, Derrida was visited with a suggestive “objection” that occasioned his first encounter with theology. “[V]ery early on,” he says, “I was accused of—rather than being congratulated for—resifting the procedures of negative theology” (<italic>Psy</italic>., 537/DNT, 74), of putting these procedures to work, it would seem, in the service of some<italic>magnum mysterium</italic>called<italic>différance</italic>.</p>

                     <p>By 1993, Derrida hirnself, like Levinas before hirn, had begun to associate hirnself with the word “messianic”—almost always by way of a reference to Walter Benjamin¹—and to feel around for a general “messianic” structure or “messianicity” that he could live with, one that is cut to fit the hand of deconstruction.</p>
                     <p>In the 1989 text of “The Force of Law,”² delivered in New York, Derrida said:</p>
                     <p>I would hesitate to assimilate too quickly this “idea of justice” to a regulative idea (in the Kantian sense), to a messianie promise or to other horizons<italic>of the same type</italic>. (FL,</p>
