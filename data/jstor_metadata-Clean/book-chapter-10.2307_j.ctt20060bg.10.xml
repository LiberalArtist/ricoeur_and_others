      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.</p>

Earlier, in January 2015, French prime minister Manuel Valls had used the word<italic>war</italic>, a word he has since repeated on multiple occasions along with French president François Hollande as a way of describing the November attacks: “What I want to say to the French people, is that France is at war. What happened was a systematically organized act of war.”² A few days later, on November 16, speaking in Versailles before a joint session of parliament, François Hollande declared</p>

                     <p>The links between colonization and the Republic remain of utmost importance and relevance to contemporary debates in French society. Might colonization, in fact, represent the inevitable reverse side of what stands as a universal utopia, one that invariably becomes less and less “pure” as one moves away from the center (the metropole), and as the color of the people who are theoretically placed under its “protection” becomes darker? Such complex questions are no doubt impossible to answer definitively. However, they do have the merit of clearly setting out an issue that has, until now, often been avoided or, at times,</p>

                     <p>In a book I published in 1991,<italic>La gangrène et l’oubli</italic>,¹ I analyzed how a number of subtle lies and repressions, how denial and memory gaps, from across the Mediterranean, worked together to hide and distort the history of the Algerian War. Today, the memory of that war has surged to the fore massively, in both Algerian and French socie ties. However, behind that war hides another, even bigger piece of history, that of colonization. That “block” of history remains imposing and almost unmoving, precisely at the origin of the Algerian War; and there is still much to be explored</p>

                     <p>Why is colonial, and postcolonial history in particular, so marginalized in French academic research? Is such a question even legitimate today? Certainly, if we consider colonization to be one of the major historic phenomena of the past two centuries, then there can be no doubt as to the pertinence of these questions. But then what accounts for such marginalization? Admittedly, I came to this question by way of two experiences. The first was noticing how little visibility French research had in the fields of colonial and postcolonial studies,¹ and even the sometimes condescending attitude of some of our foreign colleagues</p>

                     <p>The days following decolonization must have surely been triumphant. At least that is what third worldism and the promises of development for all in the South and reformist unionism in a democratic world in the North would have had you believe. But these positions did not take into consideration the rush to forget it all—since it could not be erased—as soon as in de pendence was declared. Amnesia and disillusionment were introduced into our world, which was fashioned by the dynamics of the post-national, the postindustrial, and the postcolonial. Far from stopping at the borders, these dynamics crossed</p>

                     <p>Listening to what students say, following the news, and reviewing the results of a survey conducted in 2003, one could easily conclude that the topic of colonial history and immigration in French schools was severely underrepresented. The survey we took does indeed show a lack of understanding—or at best a very vague understanding—of colonial and immigration history, despite the fact that a real need to learn about these topics, particularly in order to better understand current events, has been expressed.</p>
                     <p>However, although the history of immigration is, for the most part, absent from the curriculum through secondary school,</p>

                     <p>The very idea of “memory wars” has triggered considerable controversy, especially when it is considered in a “memorial” temporality that begins with the centennial of the French Revolution in 1889 (and on the eve of the “Dreyfus affair”), spans the twentieth century, and engages with a new century that finds itself at the intersection of several “memory wars.” A trace of this “omnipresence in the present day” was evident in President Nicolas Sarkozy’s speeches and ongoing “dialogue” with the past: from the “rebels of 1917” to the “memory of Vichy,” and passing by way of the “speeches” in Dakar and</p>

                     <p>An analysis of print and televised media in France is key to understanding dominant representations of the figure of the “Arab” in France today. The term is used inconsistently, grounded as it is in a series of confused ideas and ambivalent attitudes surrounding a range of often interchangeable symbolic categories that include<italic>immigrant</italic>,<italic>foreigner</italic>,<italic>Muslim</italic>,<italic>Islamist</italic>,<italic>banlieue youth</italic>, and<italic>terrorist</italic>. In order to grasp the function and functioning of this semantic fog, one must look more carefully at how the “Arab” has been constructed (and reformulated through various discursive practices), beginning in the 1980s.</p>

These have included the implementation of protectionist, but isolationist, measures and efforts aimed at restoring “social order” through a process of group segmentation. Communication across gender lines in these neighborhoods has diminished, identities have become increasingly ethnicized, and the importance of religion has been amplified. Today’s France is witnessing the creation of ghettos, neighborhoods populated by what are effectively second-class citizens, and who have become increasingly withdrawn into their own communities as a reaction to their lack of integration.</p>

If writing history is a process—it can be corrected, recontextualized, reformulated—memory is, at the moment it is articulated, a source of imagination, newfound awareness, and conflict. Its impact—both socially and politically—is immediate and indelible. It leaves its mark on the social imaginary.⁴ Memory is therefore an issue that should be considered with much precaution and distance. But</p>

                     <p>In 2009, the four French overseas Départements et régions d’outre mer (Overseas departments and regions, DROMs)—Martinique, Guadeloupe, Guiana, and Réunion—were shaken by protests initiated by various social movements. Guadeloupe was particularly affected. A fifth DROM was added during the same period: Mayotte. The news brought images of the tumult coursing through these small French territories scattered in the Americas and Indian Ocean to audiences in mainland France. How can we begin to explain the fact that conflicts that began in Guadeloupe eventually spread to other overseas departments? What gave rise to them? Does France have a prob lem</p>

The options were<italic>either</italic>to discredit the very concept of race and prohibit the use of the word or to preserve its scientific validity (specifically in classifications to describe human populations), but strip it of its hierarchizing value as a means of addressing, and quelling, potential uses for segregation and extermination.

What has long set France apart from other European countries is the almost visceral character that these debates have taken over what has now been almost thirty years.³ The evolution of</p>

However, the issue concerns the general be hav ior of French society in the 2000s and 2010s. As society seemingly becomes more and more open, public opinion and immigration policies have gotten more and more repressive. In that re spect, former president Nicolas Sarkozy and current prime minister Manuel Valls share something in common: they both have foreign</p>

                     <p>When France’s imperial period came to an end and in light of the trauma of losing Indochina and Algeria, French schools in mainland France continued to teach a very traditional history. The curriculum, which emphasized the glorious feats of France’s past, was a legacy from Ernest Lavisse and de Malet and Isaac. A monolithic narrative proudly featured France’s Enlightenment thinkers, whose ideas had been spread throughout the world, notably in the colonies. Meanwhile, the French school system was also affected by the Trente Glorieuses , the postwar period of economic and social growth in French society. The shock of decolonization</p>

                     <p>The enemy—red in the past, today green—is at our door. Ready to overcome us. On the verge of subverting our society and of perverting our way of life—of subjugating our civilization. In the 1930s, the enemy sought to “Sovietize” France, to take power, to impose Soviets, and to destroy our colonial empire; in the early twenty-first century, the enemy intends to “Islamize” our country, destroy our “national identity,” wage international jihad, destroy Israel. Every decade has its color. Every era has its “enemy within.” In the 2010s, as in the 1930s, France continues to perceive of itself</p>

                     <p>Are the majority of French people afraid of Islam? A number of opinion polls over the past de cade would appear to suggest as much, just as the rise in popularity of the Front National (a populist party that has fed on the fear of foreigners since its creation in 1972) during recent regional elections also seems to confirm (27 percent of votes in December 2015). However, the French are not necessarily more mistrustful of Muslims than are the Italians, Polish, Spanish, Dutch, Germans, or the British. The French context must be understood in historical terms that are not merely</p>

                     <p>When it comes to the question of colonialism in France, more often than not, the tendency is to conjure a range of “philanthropic” or “humanist” measures. This is somehow deemed necessary in the process of extracting populations residing is farflung places out of the heart of darkness, and thereby justifying overseas colonial expansion. As a consequence, there has been no real debate on these and related questions, even though formerly colonized peoples and their descendants continue to be the object of racial prejudice and subjected to humiliation. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to alleviate tensions and to encourage the authorities</p>

                     <p>The Front National, which reached new heights in popularity in the first round of regional elections in December 2015, has developed a strategy, since 2010, around exposing Islamization, which it claims is inherent to multicultural society. Meanwhile, Islamophobia cannot be limited to members of the Front National, and it has certainly not replaced antisemitism. Unburdened from ideological partisanship, antisemitism has become a product of cultural consumption. The move to the political right in thinking about such questions has created a fragmented image of a French society in need of an authoritarian response. It has revitalized the fear of otherness in</p>

The eighty-three-year-old leader, who had participated in just about every shift on the French farright since the 1950s, entrusted his party to his youngest daughter, Marine. Beyond the fact the she bore her father’s name (not irrelevant in a party where the leader had always embodied its very essence), Marine received massive support during an internal primary—67.65 percent—anunprece dented level of support in the FN, in a race which had pitted her against Bruno Gollnisch.</p>

                     <p>The overused notion of “populism” should not be conflated with the term bandied about by politicians who say what they think voters want to hear. Nor is populism related to popular preoccupations, those of artisans, fishermen, workers, hunters, farmers, engineers, doctors, the rich, or the poor. In the enthusiasm surrounding populism, concrete categories within the population—professions, at times contradictory interests, class distinctions—tend to be elided over in favor of a fiction of an all encompassing, omnipresent, and omniscient people, who are believed to have a single soul and unified identity. Populists can be either Marxist, like Stalin, or</p>

Indeed, in the salty marshes of this nascent century, there is nothing left to hide. All taboos have been lifted; all interdictions banished.

This represented a sharp rise, given that it had announced in early June 2015 having recorded approximately 100,000 illegal crossings since the month of January, compared with 40,000 over the same period in 2014.

                     <p>When the ink on the bottom of the French-Algerian Evian Accords, signed on March 18, 1962, dried, officializing the end of paternalistic colonialism,¹ a new era might very well have gotten underway, both at the level of international relations and for both French and Algerian socie ties. One might have thought that the<italic>Colonial Party’s</italic>old forms of justification—and even selfaggrandizement—would slowly give way to a thoughtful appraisal of France’s presence overseas.² A new era<italic>might</italic>very well have begun, one could have thought.

                     <p>After three decades of silence (1960 1990) and amnesty/amnesia, we have now entered a time of confrontation—set off by debates surrounding the Algerian War in the 1990s—memory wars at the highest levels of politics—from the law on “positive colonization” in 2005 to the memorial laws of 2011—and from the “chaos of individual grief”¹ toward claims articulated by every<italic>community</italic>for recognition. The colonial past has become political. On the one hand, there is the left, which has never been able to confront this history or even imagine a scholarly approach to it. On the other,</p>

We are now in a new era.”¹ Warning that the jihadist attacks perpetrated in France in January and November 2015 signaled the advent of an unpre ce dented wave of threats to the nation to which no early end could be foreseen, Valls urged the adoption of constitutional revisions designed to give the state sweeping emergency powers and the right to strip terrorists of French citizenship. It is true that France has never before faced attacks on this scale from</p>
