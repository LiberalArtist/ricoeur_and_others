                     <p>Soviet cultural policy in Eastern Europe after World War II has been the topic of many articles, monographs and dissertations since the initial post-war years. The growth or decline of interest in the subject has often been determined by the political and social context of a specific moment, with the research focus shifting accordingly. The novelty of the theme and the extent of transformations in the European political and cultural sphere spurred the earliest studies, in which researchers focused on ‘the scope and scale of oppression and uniformity behind the “Iron Curtain,” as did later scholars working on the immediate</p>

                     <p>This chapter concerns debates that took place in Eastern Europe during the 1950s and 1960s that, as I believe, played a crucial role in the cultural development of the region after the war. More specifically, this is a story about how Eastern European writers tried to come to terms with socialist realism and how they strove to get rid of it. For purposes of practical convenience, ‘Eastern Europe’ refers here to all the countries that were under Soviet hegemony after the war, including the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia; discussion on the issue of Central Europe is beyond the scope</p>

                     <p>As an heir to the pre-revolutionary Russian intelligentsia, the Bolshevik state, down to its very bureaucracy, was highly literature-centric. From very early on in this state’s existence, it projected in its dealings with foreign countries a belief in literature’s capacity to change society; thus, it tried to organize ‘the progressive forces’ of world literature through international writers’ organizations, writers’ congresses, frequent bilateral visits, multilingual literary magazines and massive translation initiatives. Once developed, these organizing forms stayed relatively constant; what changed was Soviet foreign policy, and with it, Soviet cultural policy abroad. As the sectarian Third Period of the late 1920s</p>

                     <p>The Polish ‘Thaw’ followed the same trajectory as the Soviet one, except that it moved faster, was more radical and its criticism of Stalinism was more public.¹ However, the euphoria after the III Plenum of the Polish United Worker’s Party (21–24 January 1955), which strengthened the emerging reformist movement within the party, was quickly silenced by loud calls to stop ‘the dismantling of socialism’. Just a few months later the limits of liberalization became clear. When the chairman of the Polish Writers’ Union Jerzy Putrament spoke at the enlarged Plenum of the Executive Board of the Polish Writers’ Union</p>

This was an advisory body to the Ministry of Information of Czechoslovakia, which for three years, since autumn 1945, had been assessing Czech (not Slovak, for there were different print regulations in place in the eastern part of Czechoslovakia) publishers’ plans and recommending to the ministry whether or not to allow the publication of particular titles.

This sequence had fatal implications for the staff of the Soviet institutions of cultural propaganda and their ‘intelligentsia’ – established writers, experts on foreign literature, and others. They entered the Cold War with the recent wartime allies without any strategy or techniques, while already in the process of fighting for their lives against domestic crackdown and reaction.

                     <p>The history of introducing Soviet-type political regimes in countries along the European border of the USSR has long been the subject of vehement scholarly and journalistic discussions. Historians still cannot agree on what plan exactly Stalin had in mind for Eastern Europe immediately after the war. Remarkably, Soviet and Western assessments of the post-war situation in the region coincided almost completely. The American diplomat George Kennan compared Eastern Europe in the transitional period between war and peace to a ‘malleable and pliant mass’, while Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov spoke of it being in ‘a liquid state’.¹ There was nothing</p>

His prophecy that the conquerors would achieve ‘a glorious victory […] on this front as well’¹ was, however, not to be fulfilled. The legacy of Nazi propaganda, a fear of revenge, a disavowal of their crimes and guilt, the violence of the advancing Red Army, the constant threat of robbery and plunder, the shock of defeat – all of this led most Germans to reject Soviet governance.

                     <p>East Germany’s post-war position within the Soviet sphere of influence stands out for several reasons. First, it was the German nation that gave rise to National Socialism and wreaked the havoc and devastation that raged across Europe, especially Eastern Europe, during World War II. Even if East German political leaders and intellectuals had struggled for 12 years underground and in exile on behalf of the ‘other’, the ‘better’ anti-fascist Germany, the burden of National Socialism weighed heavily on their efforts to eradicate vestiges of the past that still lingered in the post-war present. Secondly, the anti-fascist vision of a demilitarized,</p>

                     <p>Histories of Hungarian literature written in the past two decades tend to describe ‘the episode of socialist realism’ as an imposed deviation or even a gap within the continuity of the Hungarian literary tradition. This idea of ‘interrupted continuity’ seems to be present also in the scholarship on twentieth-century Romanian literature. In his overview of the forerunners and beginnings of postmodernist literature in Romania, Mircea Cărtărescu, who is perhaps the best-known living Romanian novelist, speaks about the ‘frozen’ nature of Romanian culture and society during the 1950s and the 1960s.¹ Researchers of literary history in these countries seem to agree</p>

This event conditioned much of the development of Yugoslav society over the following decades. In its cultural policy, the relationship between the CPY’s proclaimed socialist ideals and allowing for flexibility and change remained ambiguous throughout the years of the existence of the state.

In the short period between 1945 and 1948, a part of modern domestic policy and of the ideological and literary traditions was actualized in programme-guided discussions and debates, but also in legally binding documents. The first line of this actualization movement reached back to the depth of the nineteenth century – to the Romantic concept of mighty Slavdom and pan-Slavic reciprocity. This line had a politically and ideologically declarative form, which</p>

                     <p>In the national elections that took place in Hungary in November 1945, the Hungarian Communist Party (HCP) was in for a surprise: it lost. It lost, even though its leaders, most of whom had returned home after a prolonged stay in the Soviet Union, were convinced that they would easily score a victory over their political rivals.¹ But it was not meant to be, and the HCP had to prepare for a longer struggle for the establishment of socialism than it had hoped. This chapter looks at the repercussions of this failure on the Hungarian cultural and, more specifically, literary</p>

                     <p>As in most other socialist countries, in Bulgaria the introduction of the socialist regime was accompanied by an imperative to engage in active criticism and, more importantly, self-criticism, often regardless of one’s professional affiliations, status and true political sympathies. The campaign for criticism and self-criticism, initiated almost immediately after the coup d’état in September 1944, continued until the 1960s, with varying degrees of intensity. At first it was ‘alien elements’ who were required to make public self-critical statements – people who had either actively opposed the Bulgarian Communist Party or else refused to cooperate with it. A few years later</p>

                     <p>A literary magazine, or a ‘thick journal’, was a unique element of Soviet literary culture. Modelled on pre-revolutionary literary magazines that published the writings of authors belonging to a certain creative movement, or works of a certain genre, in the Soviet time thick journals turned into a voice of the authorities, promoting the ‘ideologically correct’ literature of the new age. After all the writers’ organizations in the USSR had been disbanded in 1932 and the Soviet Writers’ Congress called shortly thereafter to set the standards of socialist realism, the new function of thick journals became clear: they were to operate</p>

                     <p>Looking at the most influential manifestos of socialist realism in Czechoslovakia after the communist takeover in 1948, one may come to the conclusion that it was poetry that occupied a privileged place in the literary policy of the new regime. In his presentation at the preliminary conference of the Czech Writers’ Union in 1950 Ladislav Štoll, a key figure of post-1948 cultural politics, literary historian and renowned communist official – aiming to give a more precise formulation to the official Party conception of the new literature – touched upon the development of socialist poetry over the previous 30 years.

                     <p>Ljudevit Galic was an actor, with no formal education. Mobilized in 1941, he struggled through the war acting in provincial theatres. He joined the partisans in Bosnia. When the war was almost over, in 1945, he was 26. Freedom was near, and he was anxious: ‘My worries […] were great. What will become of us when this disaster is over? Everything is a menace and mostly the thought that “time will overtake us” unless we educate ourselves. Endless discussions in last few months discovered many gaps in our general and professional education. We have sunk very low,’ he wrote in</p>

                     <p>‘Lager oder Salon’ (‘Camp or Salon’) was the title of an article published in a mainstream National Socialist newspaper in 1935. The subtitle of the article was ‘Wandel der Lebensformen’ (‘A Transformation of Lifestyle’), the reference being to the inevitable decision awaiting each citizen of the country: either in favour of the cosy, comfortable, individualistic bourgeois salon, or else in favour of the rough, primitive, communal barracks of the comrades’ working camps, these latter being the embodiment of the new spirit, of the future itself.

                     <p>Hannah Arendt remarked that one of the paradoxes inherent in totalitarian states is that, on the one hand, their professed veneration of transformations induces in them a deep-seated fear of stability and permanence, but on the other hand, for these regimes to function, their institutions require a certain degree of predictability and continuity.¹ The Soviet experience, reproduced in different versions multiple times beyond the borders of the country, is a testimony to the truth of this statement. At the same time, it also points to yet another aporia at the heart of the great political and cultural experiment. As the</p>
