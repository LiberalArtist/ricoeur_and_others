                        <italic>In a book about a strand</italic> of skepticism in certain twentieth-century novels, why turn to <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> as a precursor? <italic>Don Quixote</italic> or <italic>Tristram Shandy,</italic> say, would seem more natural choices, but I begin instead with Milton’s epic because of what might be called its orientation to human finitude. The skeptics in and around the books I will discuss later regard human finitude as a matter of the gravest concern, even as the source of failure of all human endeavor. <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> does not share in this confusion, but it does recognize it, portray it in intimate detail, and clear</p>

                        <italic>Because Julio Cortázar’s</italic> novel of 1963, <italic>Rayuela,</italic> or <italic>Hopscotch,</italic> explores basic questions about knowing, and about reading and writing in particular, it can be considered a broad investigation of hermeneutics, the pervasive and perpetual work of understanding that constitutes human being. It should not surprise us, then, that we encounter at the heart of <italic>Hopscotch</italic> doubts very similar to those so important to <italic>Paradise Lost</italic>. Horacio Oliveira, Cortázar’s protagonist, is Satan’s true heir, an engine-idler of the first order. By the time we happen upon Oliveira, he has long thought himself impaired by the original sin of historicity. The doubt</p>

                        <italic>In chapter 90 of Hopscotch,</italic> Oliveira says, “But everything was fissionable and would immediately allow an opposite interpretation” (417). Later he says of Morelli that toward the end of his career “he could write only with effort, examining at every turn a possible opposite, the hidden fallacy … suspicious that every clear idea was inevitably a mistake or half-truth, mistrusting the words …” (440). If in the second quotation we substitute “understand” for “write,” we have two descriptions of the problem at the heart of Kafka’s fiction: the seeming interminability of interpretation. The comparison of Cortázar with Kafka brings to</p>

Of those things that Adam and Eve come to know sharply only by their loss, the most important is God’s presence.
