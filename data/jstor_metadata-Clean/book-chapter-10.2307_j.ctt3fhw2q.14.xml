         <p>Selected by<italic>Choice</italic>magazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1996<italic>Gender on the Market</italic>is a study of Moroccan women's expressive culture and the ways in which it both determines and responds to current transformations in gender roles. Beginning with women's emergence into what has been defined as the most paradigmatic of Moroccan male institutions-the marketplace-the book elucidates how gender and commodity relations are experienced and interpreted in women's aesthetic practices. Deborah Kapchan compellingly demonstrates that Moroccan women challenge some of the most basic cultural assumptions of their society-especially ones concerning power and authority.</p>

About a dozen people surround her, a few of them men.

Apart from the vendors of wool, eggs, bread, and chickens, however, women were primarily buying rather than selling. The scene is different today. There are now so many women marketers in Beni Mellal that they have had to set up their goods outside the market walls. There is no room for them within. Women have also begun to hawk herbs in the ḥalqa, the performance section of the marketplace. Their role as herbalists and their elaborate oratory in the suq mark a feminine</p>

Formal language in the informal setting of the suq does not limit meaning; rather, by embodying words and gestures customarily performed by and for men, women orators create a multivocalic and hybrid discourse in a context of heteroglossia.

                     <p>In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”</p>

The Moroccan bride negotiates between relations of reciprocity (between two families who are merging their destinies by mingling their bloods) and relations of commodity, expressed in the bride’s ability to “make good” and goods in the material economy. Ritual, in representing an intensification of social relations and values, provides a potent example of social change.

                     <p>When Khadouj was still pre-pubescent (in the early 1920s), her soon-to-be mother- and sister-in-law came to her house for a tattooing ritual. The sister-in-law held Khadouj down while the mother tattooed her wrists, ankles, and chin with a needle dipped in ashes to enhance her appeal. She was thus made the domain not only of her husband but of his entire family, and most particularly of his mother. The tattoo, meant to beautify, also marked her as property long before the consummation of the marriage. As a promised article of exchange between two families in a tribal village in the</p>

They began yelling at the few women who were in the market gossiping, saying that if the women didn’t shut up, God would give them a “women’s war.” Well, one woman present didn’t like the attitude of the man who said this and she decided to show him what female revenge was.</p>

                     <p>The significance of this study is not in recognizing that daily life is comprised of small-scale displacements, replacements, and hybridizations of cultural forms (as opposed to the dramatic paradigm shifts that Kuhn describes 1962); nor is the attribution of responsibility for such processes to the market new (Appadurai 1990; Hannerz 1987). Rather, the study illuminates how incremental changes leading to larger paradigm shifts take place discursively and in relation to the marketplace, indicated by subtle transformations of both speech genres and larger conceptual categories.</p>
