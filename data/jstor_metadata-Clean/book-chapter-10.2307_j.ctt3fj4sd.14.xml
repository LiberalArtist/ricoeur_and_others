      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to<italic>Detecting Texts</italic>contend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.<italic>Detecting Texts</italic>includes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.</p>

                     <p>This collection of critical essays is the first to track down the metaphysical detective story, a genre of largely twentieth-century experimental fiction with a flamboyant yet decidedly complex relationship to the detective story, and a kinship to modernist and postmodernist fiction in general. The metaphysical detective story is distinguished, moreover, by the profound questions that it raises about narrative, interpretation, subjectivity, the nature of reality, and the limits of knowledge. For these reasons, the aims of our volume are different from—and indeed, go far beyond—those of other books that have been published on detective fiction, pop culture, postmodernist</p>

Key works of detective fiction in the twentieth century, especially in its latter half, represent a distinct departure from Poe’s “tales of ratiocination” and, indeed, from traditional hermeneutics.² Before we can delineate this later</p>

Whether consciously or unconsciously, the genre comments upon the process of sifting through signs, and ultimately upon the possibility of deriving order from the seeming chaos of conflicting signals and motives. The unraveling work of the detective within the story mirrors and assists the work of the reader, as both try to piece together the disparate signs that might eventually solve the mystery.

                     <p>Since the early 1950s, Alain Robbe-Grillet’s writings and films have influenced that body of French literary investigative work which reflects the “suspicion” (in Nathalie Sarraute’s sense) that the real world and natural language might be arbitrary constructions. Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.</p>
