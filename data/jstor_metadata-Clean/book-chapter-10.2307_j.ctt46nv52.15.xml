         <p>The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.</p>

Great coal tipples loomed over miners’ homes shrouded in the acid smoke of coke ovens.

                     <p>On April 21, 1914, class warfare raged on the plains of southern Colorado. Near the Ludlow railroad depot, troops of the Colorado National Guard hunkered down in a burned-out union tent colony, besieged by armed strikers. The morning before, they had attacked the colony with machine gun and rifle fire and, after a daylong battle, driven the strikers out. The bodies of two women and ten children lay at the bottom of a dark, smoky pit in the colony. Passengers on a passing train were horrified to see the corpses of union leaders Louis Tikas and James Fyler sprawled by</p>

                     <p>The Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project (CCWAP) strove to complement the written history of the 1913–1914 labor strike in southern Colorado. While the written history provides a thorough description of the events and their larger implications, it does not paint a complete picture of how the events affected the daily lives of the men, women, and children who experienced them. Further, it cannot show the living conditions that led up to the strike or illustrate the strike’s effect on the material conditions of the workers and their families. Such is the nature of history.

This community offered more than shelter to strikers and their families. It was also a symbolic expression of what miners and their families wanted in the establishment of place and home in the coal camps. The strike became a struggle for miners to develop the material and social conditions that would give them a larger voice in negotiating community in the coal camps.

                     <p>The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,</p>

The sixth of the seven demands encompassed the frustration miners and their families felt over their employers’ intrusion into all aspects of home life—a lack of choice in where to live, where to shop, and where to obtain medical services.

The goal of working with union members and organized labor, an audience outside the traditional realm of archaeology, confronts us with a history little studied by archaeologists and little taught within general historical education. The Ludlow Massacre, like many historical episodes, is a silenced history, written out to the margins of national history.

When the 2005 Society for Historical Archaeology meetings were held in York, England, the two of us took the opportunity to get in a good visit. As newly minted faculty teaching historical archaeology, we spent much of our time talking about teaching, discussing students, and comparing notes about pedagogy as viewed from different sides of the Atlantic. During one of these meandering conversations, our discussion turned to the Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project. In the field, only one of us (Clark) had intersected with this research, once at the inception</p>
