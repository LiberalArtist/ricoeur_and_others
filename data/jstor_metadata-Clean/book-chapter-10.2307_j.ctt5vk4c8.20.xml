      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Sixty years ago, at the height of World War II, an extraordinary series of gatherings took place at Mount Holyoke College in western Massachusetts. During the summers of 1942–1944, leading Europeanﬁgures in the arts and sciences met at the college with their American counterparts for urgent conversations about the future of human civilization in a precarious world. Two Sorbonne professors, the distinguished medievalist Gustave Cohen and the existentialist philosopher Jean Wahl, organized these “Pontigny” sessions, named after an abbey in Burgundy where similar symposia had been held in the decades before the war. Among the participants—many of whom were Jewish or had Jewish backgrounds—were the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Rachel Bespaloff, the poets Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens, the anthropologist Claude LéviStrauss and the linguist Roman Jakobson, and the painters Marc Chagall and Robert Motherwell. In this collection of original essays, Stanley Cavell and Jacques Derrida lead an international group of scholars—including Jed Perl, Mary Ann Caws, Jeffrey Mehlman, and Elisabeth YoungBruehl—in assessing the lasting impact and contemporary signiﬁcance of Pontignyen Amérique. Rachel Bespaloff, a tragicﬁgure who wrote a major work on the Iliad, is restored to her rightful place beside Arendt and Simone Weil. Anyone interested in the “intellectual resistance” of Francophone intellectuals and artists, and the inspiring support from such Americanﬁgures as Stevens and Moore, will want to read this pioneering work of scholarship and historical recreation.</p>

                     <p>Pontigny began for me with a faded snapshot, a freeze frame in time. I stumbled across it among the swatch of photographs in the center of Peter Brazeau’s<italic>Parts of a World</italic>, his fragmentary “oral history” of people who had known the poet Wallace Stevens. The black and white image, slightly blurred by bright sunlight, shows Stevens, in his habitual business suit—the uniform of an insurance executive from Hartford, Connecticut—seated on the lawn by a brick building beside a diminutive man with wavy hair and glasses. Brazeau’s caption reads: “Jean Wahl and Wallace Stevens at Mount Holyoke College</p>

                     <p>Of all the eyewitness accounts of the annual Décades de Pontigny, the tenday<italic>entretiens</italic>or symposia held at Pontigny, France, from 1910 to 1940, there is one that has, in retrospect, a particular resonance. For Walter Benjamin, a keen observer of French and European intellectual life and an occasional, admiring participant at Pontigny, the<italic>entretiens</italic>conducted there in 1939 effectively signaled the decline of what Pontigny had stood for throughout the period between the two world wars: the diffusion of French culture and the spread of a cosmopolitan, pacifist ideal. Benjamin observed in a letter to Max Horkheimer that “Pontigny</p>

                     <p>I cannot think of a more propitious moment than our own to reflect on the extraordinary event that was Pontigny-en-Amérique, a series of three summer retreats held during World War II in which some of Europe’s best minds gathered at Mount Holyoke College to talk and argue about nothing less than the future of Western civilization. In light of the frenzy of anti-French sentiment that has swelled in this country in the wake of the war in Iraq—an occurrence I fear I cannot take lightly, “freedom fries” notwithstanding—the words of one of Pontigny’s creators, the eminent medieval scholar</p>

                     <p>In rethinking France’s identities through the memory of its interactions with its various “others,” inside and outside of France, I note that the Mount Holyoke celebration calls attention to the interplay between margin and center, of French intellectuals and artists decentered or marginalized by the war striving to make Mount Holyoke, between 1942 and 1944, a new “marginal center,” if you will. I am not sure, however, who is the center and who the margin, the French or the Americans, in this context. I think that while all were discussing emerging trends, new forms of creativity, new forms of art,</p>

                     <p>Adventurous philosophical thought was always at the center of the Pontigny tradition, especially when the philosopher-poet Jean Wahl assumed the direction of Pontigny-en-Amérique after 1942. Wahl invited his favorite American poets, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, along with John Peale Bishop, to speak at Mount Holyoke during the summer of 1943. The topic was to be the relation of poetry and philosophy. Moore lectured on “Feeling and Precision,” carefully choosing her examples of understated eloquence from poetic responses to war. “An unselfish experiment like that of the Pontigny Committee,” she wrote in a letter, “leaves a certain memory of exaltation,</p>

                     <p>“The Figure of the Youth as Virile Poet” is a confusing text, but it does have a recognizable armature of sorts, pertaining to the three references to a muse said to be “a kind of sister of the Minotaur.” The mythographer immediately thinks of Ariadne and Phaedra, but because she first appears in relation to a “younger figure,” a “son still bearing the antique imagination of the father,” Phaedra-and-Hippolytus (rather than Ariadne-and-Theseus) seems the more apt allusion. This impression is reinforced by a number of additional elements. First, there is the somewhat jarring insistence on the “virility” of the poet-youth,</p>

He was a descendant of one of the<italic>Mayflower</italic>pilgrims and also of a pharmacist who owned a monopoly on the marketing of bicarbonate of soda in the United States (the source of Church’s immense fortune). At the age of twenty-one, Church went to Europe. He studied music in Munich and chemistry in Geneva before beginning a sojourn in Paris in 1905. After his return to the United States, he married for the first time and had a daughter. For Church, however, America was “neither the wind nor the sea gull’s</p>

                     <p>Lionello Venturi was the only art historian invited to come to the Pontigny encounters at Mount Holyoke, and he came twice.¹ The decision to invite Venturi was significant. No European art historian in exile had his credentials as an anti-fascist. If his physical stature was unusual—a gentle giant in the photographs shot at Mount Holyoke, he is always towering somewhat clumsily above his colleagues—his moral stature was equally unusual, especially in the dismal moral landscape of the twenty years of Italian Fascism.</p>

                     <p>Gustave Cohen, the medievalist and man of the theater, limped onto the Mount Holyoke campus in the summer of 1942, an ardent advocate of France.¹ Just two years earlier, he had been stripped of his post at the Sorbonne by the Vichy government and its anti-Jewish statutes. He fled to America. Exile made him all the more determined to militate for his chosen country back in Europe.</p>

                     <p>Surely Walter Benjamin, who had been at Pontigny in 1938, would have been at the Mount Holyoke Pontigny colloquia of the war years, and the pathos of those gatherings owes not a little to his absence. Benjamin called one of his protracted meditations preliminary to the Arcades Project “Zentralpark”—largely because he no doubt imagined himself working out the Baudelairean issues those pages deal with while strolling through Central Park in Manhattan. What would the final format of the Arcades Project have been? And might there not have been a Mount Holyoke<italic>Konvolut</italic>—a folder of citations and observations assembled</p>

It is the story of chance meetings, some fortuitous, some foretold, and several others missed along the way. It was in 1941, in New York City, that the young French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss first encountered the charismatic Russian linguist and onetime poet Roman Osipovich Jakobson.

                     <p>When he checked in the first summer at Pontigny-en-Amérique in 1942, Jacques Hadamard was seventy-six years old. Revered in France as the intellectual heir to Henri Poincaré, he had been world famous among mathematicians since before the turn of the century. He held professorships at the Collège de France (from 1909), at the École polytechnique (from 1912), and at the École centrale (from 1920) until his retirement from all three at the age of seventy-one in 1937.</p>

                     <p>As many of the contributors to this volume have argued, the face-to-face encounters at Pontigny-en-Amérique engendered fruitful, if subtle, shifts in the poetic, philosophical, and artistic exchanges between American and European culture. The formal and informal conversations that took place then may not have led to immediate or discernible outcomes. Nevertheless, more than sixty years later, their afterlife continues to occupy us. The contributions in this section embody the very essence of conversation as a form of action and of response to injustice and to imagining a world not prone to war and violence.</p>

                     <p>The critic Kenneth Burke once suggested that classic literary works could serve as “equipment for living” by revealing familiar narrative patterns in new and chaotic circumstances.¹ If so, it should not surprise us that European readers in times of war should look to their first poem for guidance. As early as the fall of 1935, Jean Giraudoux’s popular play<italic>La guerre de Troie n’aura pas lieu</italic>encouraged his French audience to think of their country as vulnerable Troy while an armed and menacing Hitler was the “Tiger at the Gates” (as the play was titled in English).

We have often wondered why, in 1968, just as her students were protesting America’s aggression in Vietnam, which she also opposed, Arendt chose to evoke the wars, revolutions, and unprecedented terror that had destroyed so many millions of lives in the first half of the twentieth century. Just five years earlier, in her book<italic>On Revolution</italic>, she had affirmed the political and legal principles of the Constitution of the United States, which inspired</p>

                     <p>Pontigny-en-Amérique provided a space for French refugees to gather and continue their conversation about art, ideas, and politics in the dark time of World War II. Other refugees, particularly those lucky enough to escape from Nazi Germany, were equally eager to create spaces for exchanging ideas and forging resistance, even as they found themselves in constant flight. The dark times in Europe between 1933 and 1942 are the topic of Bertolt Brecht’s conversational play about the situation of two German refugees in Scandinavian exile.¹ Brecht’s play offers both a complementary account of similar “conversations in exile” as well as some</p>

And yet, she had always shown a remarkable lucidity in the midst of her suffering, and was ready to recommend to her best friends (Gabriel Marcel, Jean Grenier, Jean Wahl) the torment of doubt as a means of sharpening one’s thinking. Like Simone Weil, Hannah Arendt, or Milena Jesenká, Franz Kafka’s friend, she was one of those Jewish women passionately attached to the truth as justice of knowledge. Her sense of</p>

In a diary of Fondane’s encounters and discussions with Shestov I came across the name of Rachel Bespaloff for the first time.¹ She appeared an irritating woman who never agreed with Shestov. Bespaloff’s father, Daniel Pasmanik, a friend of Shestov’s, introduced his daughter to him. At first, she was very impressed by Shestov. He awakened her to philosophical thought, and she is still considered a disciple of Shestov, though she later became opposed to certain</p>

                     <p>Rachel Bespaloff’s books were the only ones I ever considered stealing. I held the old copies in my hands at the Mount Holyoke College library in the spring of 2001 and seriously contemplated breaking the law and the honor code. Not having these copies would make a post-graduation attempt to write her biography nearly impossible. Right? But I couldn’t do it, not only because I have never stolen anything in my life, but also because my mother is a librarian. All books must be returned.</p>
                     <p>So I opted instead to hunt down rare copies in other countries and awaited the</p>

                     <p>First, I would like to set the scene. Mount Holyoke during World War II. Visualize two wars going on and very slight communication from the outside. The only news that we had about the war was through the newspapers or through the newsreels. We were told only what they wanted us to hear. We were not on the battlefield.</p>
                     <p>My own journey to Mount Holyoke was a very long one. I left Turkey at the age of seven. My family moved to Prague because my mother, who had been educated at Barnard and at the Sorbonne, felt she needed more</p>

                     <p>As a brand-new freshman in Pearsons Hall, I crossed College Street, walked through the gates, and fell in love with Mount Holyoke College. It is a love affair that has lasted more than fifty years. Little did I know in those early days that Mount Holyoke would change my life forever. Rachel Bespaloff was the architect of that change. Indeed, the most significant part of my college and lifetime experience was my relationship with her.</p>
                     <p>For weeks I have been searching for the appropriate words to do justice to her brilliance and magnetism. Lo and behold, I heard those word</p>

                     <p>My mother, Rachel Bespaloff, looked at a photograph of herself taken at the age of eighteen and said: “<italic>Pauvre</italic>Rachel.”¹ In her voice, I heard a world of sadness tinged with longing. She did not explain why she felt sorry for the lovely young woman in the picture, who, being only eighteen years old, appeared to have “her whole life ahead of her.” She was fifty-five when she committed suicide. I am almost seventy-six, and I don’t think I will kill myself. I, too, know a deep and abiding sadness below the surface of my everyday life, no doubt akin</p>

                     <p>The four photographs of Rachel Bespaloff—as a girl, as a young woman, and as an adult marked by the experience of exile—haunt us. The ghostly images are silent, even as the presence of this elusive and driven thinker is all around us, transported by the words of those who knew her and those who study her writing. Even as Bespaloff and many of the other Pontigny participants past and present wrote again and again of violence, I am struck by the ferment of creativity that emerged out of the encounters of Masson and Chagall, Stevens and Moore, and</p>
