      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Cassirer thought of culture anthropologically as the entire complex of human modes of meaning and existence: it encompassed science, technology, language, and social life in addition to art, religion, and philosophy. This conception of culture and Cassirer's theory of symbolism anticipated much of later cultural theory. In this collection of essays, eminent Cassirer scholars examine the many different aspects of his thinking on this subject and demonstrate how pioneering and important it is to cultural studies.</p>

                     <p>The essays in this volume examine Ernst Cassirer’s philosophy of “symbolic forms” as a theory of culture. Some address this topic in general philosophical terms, while others investigate more specific issues. In this introduction we address the question of culture in the broader contexts of theory and practice, to which Cassirer has much to offer.</p>
                     <p>The term “cultural studies” and its basic methodological orientation derive from the activities of the Centre of Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, England. Beginning in the 1960s, the study of literature at that institution was expanded to include nontraditional depositories of culture, such as film</p>

                     <p>Cassirer’s philosophy, in the end, is a philosophy of culture. He makes this clear in the title of his book<italic>An Essay on Man: An Introduction to a Philosophy of Culture</italic>, published a year before his death, which he intended to be a summary of his philosophy of symbolic forms. In a review of this work, Brand Blanshard, while expressing admiration for Cassirer’s great learning, regrets its lack of speculative depth. He says: “It is hard not to think, as one reads a book so wealthy as this in historic and scientific erudition, but at the same time so oddly</p>

My thesis is that the concept of culture is coming more and more to fulfill a metaphysical function and that in this way the philosophy of culture is being transformed—explicitly or implicitly—into a new<italic>prima philosophia</italic>.</p>

                     <p>Ernst Cassirer’s philosophy of culture steered philosophical thought in a new direction. In contrast to both the unmediated unity of being in traditional metaphysics and the epistemic unity of the transcendental subject in modern, critical philosophy, his theory of cultural symbols assumes the object of philosophical reflection to be irreducibly pluralist. His approach raises two fundamental questions. First, is the philosophy of symbolic forms a substitute for metaphysics or does it require a metaphysical foundation to remain consistent with its own principles? Second, how can it discuss contingent matters, such as the historical process of culture, without losing its philosophical</p>

                     <p>Whatever else one might say about him, Ernst Cassirer would seem indubitably to be a modern philosopher, not only in the contingency of his birth, but in the nature of his concerns. Like so many modernist artists, he is consumed by a passion to understand relations rather than things; thus it is not surprising that<italic>The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms</italic>is a philosophy of culture. Not merely because its basic analytic tool is semiotic of a particular kind, but because of the urgency one senses on every page to connect regions that otherwise are in danger of falling into isolation</p>

                     <p>It is often forgotten that Cassirer’s “critique of culture” entails a “critique of the subject” of culture: for culture exists only insofar as an individual subject actively engages with other subjects in its continual construction and reconstruction. For the most part, however, Cassirer speaks about the subject of culture in the most general and abstract of terms: it is the anonymous force of the “energy of<italic>Geist</italic>” that constitutes the cultural world. The task of the philosophy of symbolic forms, as a “critique of culture,” as a philosophy of Geist, is to establish the structure of the different forms of</p>

                     <p>On first looking into a text by Cassirer, nearly every reader notices two things: first, the clear language, which loses none of its immediacy even when Cassirer elucidates the most complex theoretical contexts, and, second, the difficulty, despite this clarity and vividness of language, of reconstructing the argumentative process of Cassirer’s thought.¹ Cassirer’s texts blend the objects represented with the author’s own position or thesis in each work. This individual, if not idiosyncratic type of argumentation often has the effect of making the place and voice of the author seem to disappear behind the problem in question. It is thus</p>

                     <p>Toward the end of the 1960s, as the Soviets tightened their grip upon Eastern Europe, a far more subtle invasion made its way toward the West. The translation of Mikhail Bakhtin’s<italic>Rabelais and His World</italic>in 1968 unleashed a new subversive dynamic in literary studies, which with time would make the pungent winds of the body’s after and the raucous cries of the marketplace popular subjects in the seminars of our best universities.

                     <p>Cassirer did not write an ethics, and there are interpreters of his work who consider this a deficiency. This criticism reminds me of a question an interlocutor whose name we don’t know is supposed to have directed to Martin Heidegger: “When will you write ethics?” Heidegger tells us about this event in his famous “Letter on Humanism,” which he wrote to Jean Beaufret in 1946.¹ In the wake of “destroying” the traditional understanding of humanism he raises this question after a revealing reference to a pre-Socratic philosopher, Heraclitus, and provides the following answer: ethics derives from the Greek “ethos” which</p>

                     <p>At first glance, the differences between the philosophy of Ernst Cassirer and the psychology of C. G. Jung would seem to outweigh any affinities.¹ To begin with, the one was a philosopher who taught in university departments, the other a psychologist with no philosophical training and a practice to run. (One of the most important philosophical sources for Jung was the second edition of the<italic>Allgemeines Handwörterbuch der philosophischen Wissenschaften</italic>[1832] by Wilhelm Traugott Krug [1770–1842], a distinctly popular, if famous, work.) As far as personal background and education are concerned, Cassirer was born of factory-owning, Jewish parents in</p>

Thus Cassirer’s oeuvre shows, on the one hand, the blueprint of a systematic historical epistemology and, on the other hand, the material which should have been interpreted and explained by this epistemology. The material is ordered so as to suggest a progressive epistemic development, but Cassirer nowhere applies</p>

What is perhaps not so well known is the way in which the Davos disputation can be seen as a watershed in the development of twentieth-century philosophy more generally and, in particular, in the evolving split between analytic and continental philosophical traditions. For it turns out that Rudolf Carnap (a leading representative of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricists) attended the Davos disputation, took a very serious interest in Heidegger and<italic>Being and Time</italic>when he returned to Vienna,</p>
