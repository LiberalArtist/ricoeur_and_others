      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>This collection of academic essays written by friends and colleagues of Professor Zev Garber, is a long-overdue tribute to an outstanding scholar, teacher, and mentor. Each contribution was written especially for this volume; none have been previously published. The various sections into which these essays are divided reflect the areas in which Professor Garber has devoted his own prodigious teaching and writing energies: the Holocaust, Jewish-Christian relations, philosophy and theology, history, biblical interpretation.</p>

                     <p>It was, perhaps, most propitious that I called Zev Garber on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday with a proposition: Would he honor those of us who respect him and his scholarship, and to and for whom he has been both a mentor and a friend to so many of us, by allowing me to edit a<italic>Festschrift</italic>in his honor? Taken somewhat aback by my proposal, he humbly and honestly demurred, but promised to share this request with his wife, Susan, and get back to me within the week. Which of course he did with a positive reply, and</p>

                     <p>The eminent Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson observes in his 1991 prize-winning book titled<italic>Freedom in the Making of Western Culture</italic>: “Paul [of Tarsus] is the greatest figure in the history of Western religious and social thought, not only because he was the first to pose” the most profound questions about freedom, “but because the answers he gave have determined all subsequent reflections on them.”¹ This strong claim is open to discussion, of course. But even if regarded as only partially correct, such an evaluation has created serious perplexity among many historians and culture analysts, who in their research have repeatedly</p>

                     <p>My association with the esteemed professor in blue jeans goes back to the early 1980s when he was the dynamic editor and manager of various scholarly writings connected with the National Association of Professors of Hebrew (NAPH) and I was a relative newcomer to academia. Zev, just “Zev” with no pretentious titles, encouraged me to publish and speak in his forums, to meet the accomplished scholars of that era, to write reviews for his journals. When I was unable to attend a conference at the last moment owing to a personal tragedy, Zev Garber, quite unknown to me at the</p>

                     <p>The “happenstance” of textual contiguity has always been a source of fascination to me. Does the writer intend for the reader to understand that the willful placement of words, sentences, paragraphs, and even chapters are themselves valuable insights to the meaning of the text as a whole? For example, does rereading Numbers 19 and 20 provide a “<italic>remez</italic>”—a hint—of a deeper meaning of these enigmatic chapters? In Numbers 19 we read of the<italic>parah adumah</italic>, the Red Heifer, a paradoxical ritual that need only be described as a<italic>chok</italic>, a biblical commandment that has no rationale except being</p>

                     <p>My first academic lecture was given at a regional conference of the National Association of Professors of Hebrew in Long Beach, California. My topic was “On the Use of Rabbinic Literature in Interpreting the Synoptic Gospels: The<italic>Amidah</italic>in Luke 18?” I remember fondly my excitement at my first paper, and my even greater enthusiasm at entering into what was for me foreign and somewhat subversive territory, New Testament studies. The chair of this session was our own Zev Garber, by then an old friend of mine. I will never forget Zev’s gentleness and professionalism as I proceeded to overread</p>

                     <p>The commentary of Tosafot ad loc concerning the question “What do you see?” implies that the phenomenon of “floating letters” was interpreted by the Tosafists as what we would call a “miracle,” that is, “an event that appears unexplainable by the laws of nature and so is</p>

                     <p>My relationship with Zev Garber now spans more than twenty years. He has helped me to develop a special approach to dialogue that not only shapes all of my work but also has led to the forming of a group that has now engaged in a dialogue on sacred texts for nearly fifteen years.¹ It is this aspect of my relationship with Zev that I illustrate in this essay and offer as a contribution to this<italic>Festschrift</italic>dedicated to him.

                     <p>Dr. Richard Kalmin, professor of Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, has undertaken a variety of studies, yielding these results, based on his accompanying studies:¹</p>
                     <p>1. “Formal aspects of Amoraic discourse provide evidence of generational contrast indicative of the diversity of talmudic source material … statements by later Amoraim are formally distinguishable from statements by earlier Amoraim.”²</p>
                     <p>2. We may adduce “differences between the introductory formulae introducing statements by early, later, and middle-generation Amoraim. These differences … support my claim regarding the presence of diverse sources in the Bavli, distinguishable along chronological lines.”³</p>

In the process I have been constructively challenged by and learned much from him. I hope that he has, at least on some occasions, picked up a useful insight or two from me. I consider Garber to be one of the most thoughtful scholars on either “side” of the contemporary and historic Jewish-Christian dialogue. So if the following summary of some of our exchanges, along with some related follow-up points, reveals that he has</p>

In a 1967 article he says:</p>
                     <p>The cardinal problem is not the survival of religion, but the survival of man. What is required is a continuous effort to overcome hardness of heart, callousness,</p>

                     <p>One of the most intriguing topics in the study of Haskalah literature, which has not been addressed in the critical literature so far, is the “reception” of early German Haskalah in the nineteenth century.</p>
                     <p>We know that at the end of the nineteenth century, the Berlin Haskalah was severely criticized by various Maskilim and post-Haskalah writers. However, what is less known is the historical and literary process that led to this critical position. That is to say, the transition in attitude toward early Haskalah as the centers of the Haskalah moved to the Austro-Hungarian empire and Galicia as well as</p>

The Dutch would shrug “March wags its tail” about the South Jersey weather we are experiencing: snow, high winds—the kind of foul weather that makes you want to curl up with a book, but there will be no curling this night, not even the funny kind with a broom. In a few days, the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey will be hosting the Annual Scholars Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches, and scholars strictly observing the Sabbath are beginning to arrive before the weekend. They will be housed at the Marriott Seaview,</p>

                     <p>In the last few decades, Germany and Austria have experienced a staggering expansion of the field of Jewish studies.¹ They have been set up either as separate institutes within a faculty or as programs that consist of courses related to Jewish history and culture offered by various departments. The development of Jewish studies is closely connected to political and cultural processes in society at large and cannot be described properly without taking them into account. The link between them became especially conspicuous in the former East Germany, where the crumbling of the Berlin Wall in 1989 led, among other institutions</p>

The relationship between mass death and the industrial state that became manifested in the Holocaust was both intimate and interdependent, and, as a result of it having taken place, we have forever a yardstick by which all other cases of genocide must be measured. Its message is so powerful that no definition of Western civilization</p>

                     <p>This essay is written with Zev Garber in the forefront of my mind. He has always been a whirlwind of energy and activity. For the amount of teaching he does, his level of scholarly productivity is mind-boggling. Not only that, but Zev has been the mentor of many younger scholars. He inspires, he encourages, and he finds ways to get their work published. In short, Zev is an inspiration for scholarly achievement and passion. In the area of interfaith dialogue, Zev has been a pioneer with the Scholars Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches Post-Shoah Midrash Reading Group. In</p>

                     <p>Although a good deal has been written about Holocaust education at the college and university level, little attention has been paid to what is being taught in Jewish institutions for younger students, that is, in day schools, supplementary schools, synagogues, and the like. Even less is known about what Jewish children who have no formal Jewish education after Bar/Bat Mitzvah age know about the Holocaust. Our interest in this project was sparked by a desire to know what “Millennials”—children coming of age in the last decade or so—know or think they know about the Holocaust. It is our</p>

                     <p>Do midrash.¹ Work dialogically.² Attend to the missing faces.³ These three simple sentences guide my work as a post-Holocaust theologian, educator, and religious professional. Indeed, if by midrash I mean not simply the formal interpretive work of rabbinic tradition but the hermeneutic practice of reading sacred texts and other important documents with an interruptive logic that kindles what the rabbis call the “white fire” of the texts, then these three admonitions describe my understanding of public responsibility in a post-Shoah world.</p>
                     <p>Of course, these imperatives are not exhaustive. A summons to attend to missing faces articulates a sense of responsibility</p>

                     <p>Historians, sociologists, and theologians filter the Holocaust through their very specific scholarly prisms, but our primary task remains a telling of the story, permitting students as well as the general public to understand in the most visceral manner—beyond footnotes, charts, and numbers—that a monstrous event occurred. Important as the academicians’ efforts are for maintaining historical accuracy and intellectual acuity, it is not enough to rely solely upon learned compilations of data; thus, we turn to the storytellers. Elie Wiesel and Aharon Appelfeld have long been among the most prolific novelists of the Holocaust. Each crafts fiction based upon</p>

                     <p>The most powerful components that protrude in this poem by Ronny Someck are the following two: stupendously scorching, scalding emotions and admirably aesthetic intricacy. That tempestuous “quarry” of emotions may be plausibly considered as the reservoir of the “raw materials” that feed the aesthetic mechanism and enable it to propel and operate its complex “engine.” Thus the poem’s erupting emotions act in capacity of a bedrock, on which the aesthetic mechanism is set.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, in order to appreciate to the fullest the stormy might of the poem’s emotions, one must go “backwards” and commence the reading process while concentrating on</p>

                     <p>During my attendance at the 2001 Scholars’ Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches a survivor told me that she had come to a horrifying realization about the relation between Holocaust scholars and Holocaust survivors. Speaking in a whisper, as though afraid of her own words, she said to me, “I know now what they want us to do: they want us to die.” My initial reaction was shock. For reasons I did not immediately grasp, her words brought to mind one of the conference sessions on Holocaust education. At one point the discussion in that session revolved around the</p>

                     <p>An attitudinal sea change has occurred in Europe. The nations of the European Union (EU), formerly the European Community (EC), have turned aggressively against Israel, and the post-Holocaust taboo on antisemitic speech and incitement, observed by the mainstream media and responsible political, religious, and intellectual leaders for decades, has been broken. When and why did this happen? How are we to understand the plethora of vulgarly antisemitic cartoons and caricatures, as well as statements by European leaders of a kind not uttered publicly since the fall of the Third Reich?</p>

                     <p>To what extent can we draw on our personal and professional narratives as a valid source of knowledge in order to substantiate a critique of our respective academic fields? How can we possibly crosscut from a subjective to a critical discourse, from emotion to fact and back? The following attempt to account for the unusual relationship between “my self” and “my work,” and between “my work” and “my field” will be partial both epistemologically and chronologically. The possessive pronoun in “my life” suggests ownership and control; yet, it is precisely the relinquishment of this control that I would like to</p>

                     <p>Rabbi Yosef Hayyim (1834–1909) was born in Baghdad, Iraq, into a family of notable rabbis. He was also known as Ben Ish Hai, which is the title of his major work on Jewish law published in Jerusalem in 1898. Yosef Hayyim was considered the most prominent rabbi of the Babylonian Jews in the latest generations. At the age of thirteen he was admitted to the famous Midrash Bet Zilkha, where the great Rabbi Abdallah Somekh taught him. A few years later, he retreated to his attic to study alone. At age twenty-one he was already well known for his</p>

                     <p>A building is a cultural signifier that carries meaning to all that enter or view the building. A synagogue is a building that carries meaning for those who congregate in it as a community. In those cases in which the Jewish community dissipates, the synagogue mainly serves as a building block in the construction of a collective memory and as a teaching tool.¹ The collective and individual memories are not only inscribed on the conscience of a group but also on the stones and walls of edifices which memorialize them.

                     <p>Though some have theorized that the Hebrew script in the trilingual titulus of the fourteenth-century<italic>Crucifixion</italic>by Giotto is the first appearance of Hebrew in Western art, the script in fact began to appear in that circumstance at least two centuries earlier, at the beginning of the twelfth century. Major changes in the Church’s relationship with the Jews occurred between these earliest appearances. For purposes of understanding the significance of the earlier date, the most important change was the renewal (following Jerome [347–420]) of Hebrew study among Christians. At about the same time, with Peter of Cluny (1092–1156)</p>

                     <p>From the earliest settlement period, mainstream Zionist writers have expressed concern that the psychological and ideological deformations that shaped Jewish life in the Diaspora will continue to define Israeli identity and pervert the relationship of the people of Israel to the Land of Israel. This concern, which has its canonical literary expression in Haim Hazaz’s story, “The Sermon” (1942), is still very much in evidence in A. B. Yehoshua’s masterful novel,<italic>Mr. Mani</italic>(1990). The fact that two works separated by half a century of enormous change in Israeli life share this particular concern is intriguing enough to invite critical</p>

                     <p>In 2001 I defined Israelite religions as “the varied, symbolic expressions of, and appropriate responses to the deities and powers that groups or communities deliberately affirmed as being of unrestricted value to them within their worldview.”¹ In this definition, I expressed my assumption that religion, like culture in general, is formed, formulated, and expressed through organized groups of people. Both are expressed semiotically and mediated through external realities such as spoken and written language, arts, and ritual. Though some elements of both culture and religion are private and subjective, most are public and objective. In the Ancient Near East, as</p>
