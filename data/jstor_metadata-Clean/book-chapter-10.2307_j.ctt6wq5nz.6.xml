                     <p>This chapter introduces Nietzsche’s philosophy from two different approaches. First, it presents two of Nietzsche’s own explications of his philosophy, one taken from his early writings, the other from one of his later works. The interpretation of these presentations will show the continuity of Nietzsche’s self-conception and will adumbrate the specific themes that will later be discussed in separate chapters. Second, it depicts the life of Nietzsche as the philosopher who said that “every great philosophy so far has been … the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir” (BGE 6). It depicts a</p>

It would be wrong to think that there is only one way of reading and that everyone who is able to read is likewise able to read any author. Writers wish to be read in the proper way, that is, in a manner appropriate to the way they wrote, especially in proportion to the extent to which their writing style originated in and was necessary for the content of their writing.

                     <p>The following three chapters will successively be devoted to knowledge and reality, morality and politics, and God and religion—three of the four main domains of culture we distinguished. The fourth domain, art, will appear at the end of each of these chapters. Each chapter is construed along the same lines: it first presents Nietzsche’s critique of the domain in question and then addresses Nietzsche’s own position, presuppositions, and aims. In other words, each chapter proceeds from a presentation of the negative part of his thinking to an attempt to discover its positive part.</p>

                     <p>In the preface to<italic>On the Genealogy of Morals</italic>, Nietzsche depicts the development of his thoughts on morality. He reveals that his reflections on the descent (“Herkunft”) of our moral prejudices were first expressed in his first aphoristic writing<italic>Human, All Too Human</italic>, though the ideas occurred to him when he was much younger (GM, pref. 2), even from the time when he was only thirteen (GM, pref. 3). Nietzsche’s critical thoughts on morality form a central and continuous motive that permeates (and to that extent connects) all of his writings.

                     <p>The third and last domain of Nietzsche’s analysis of culture is religion. We will see that his diagnosis of religion is also dominated by an antithesis, as the title of this chapter expresses with the last words of Nietzsche’s<italic>Ecce Homo:</italic>“—<italic>Have Ibeen understood?—Dionysus versus the Crucified</italic>.—” In this chapter we will try to understand Nietzsche along the same lines as we did in the other chapters.
