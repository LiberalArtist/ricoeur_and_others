                     <p>Amid the appalling trials and tribulations of the century we have just endured, there has been one unexpected and joyful turn of events: I have in mind the bloodless collapse of the Soviet empire, a moving spectacle that unfolded like some fascinating phenomenon of nature, following its own inscrutable rules; we watched, in fear or wonderment, but without being able to influence it in any way. And when the great castle of clay imploded, bonfires of joy throughout Europe signaled the start of unbridled celebrations. Only when the first wave of euphoria had passed did people recall themselves to the</p>

                     <p>The editors of<italic>Comparative Central European Holocaust Studies</italic>and the authors of the volume's articles subscribe to the proposition that the study of the Holocaust is of immanent social relevance and responsibility in scholarship and public discourse. In turn, the notion of the social relevance of humanities and social sciences scholarship is a tenet of the theoretical and methodological framework of comparative cultural studies (McClennen and Morello, McClennen and Fitz; Tötösy de Zepetnek,<italic>Comparative Literature</italic>, "From Comparative Literature," "Comparative Cultural," "The New Humanities"). Thus, work presented in the volume in the humanities and social sciences is based on a number</p>

                     <p>In this paper, I discuss Holocaust literature of various genres available in English—whether originally published in English or translated from Hungarian—texts that illuminate the situation in Budapest during the period of nazi occupation from 19 March 1944 until the liberation of the cities Pest, 17 January and Buda, 28 February 1945. I include the period of six months when Raoul Wallenberg was serving in Hungary's capital from July 1944 to January 1945. Wallenberg, scion of a wealthy family of Sweden, was sent to Budapest as a diplomat under the auspices of the United States War Refugee Board under</p>

                     <p>Representations of the Holocaust in literature raise some problems that do not emerge when dealing with other historical events—at least not so obviously. On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these</p>

                     <p>What is antisemitism in post-1989 Hungary? I begin with a taxonomical definition: following Fabian Virchow, I use the term "antisemitism" instead of "anti-Semitism" in order to avoid the notion that there is any kind of given "Semitism" with certain characteristics against which the antisemite holds his or her beliefs or acts. Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews." If, however, we regard those definitions by which antisemitism is a "cultural code" (see Volkov), a "worldview"</p>

                     <p>After the liberation of Hungary from nazi occupation by the Soviet army, May 1945 was an exciting and agitated time in the capital, Budapest. People were discussing the ongoing peace negotiations in Paris and cases brought before the People's Tribunals that were being reviewed on the front pages of newspapers. During World War II some 500,000 Jews had been deported from Hungary within a period of few months and the People's Tribunals (<italic>Népbíróság</italic>) were in charge of handling the war crimes and crimes against humanity that had occurred during that period (see Karsai). In the immediate postwar period, the new</p>

                     <p>In the case of an event as extreme as the Holocaust, one could be forgiven for presupposing that the boundary between factual and fictional modes of representation is sacred in its rigidity. However, it is often the case with survivor narratives that this expectation is far too proscriptive in its division of the realms of fact and fiction; as James E. Young comments, "If there is a line between fact and fiction, it may by necessity be a winding border that tends to bind these two categories as much as it separates them, allowing each side to dissolve occasionally into</p>

                     <p>Although in recent decades scholarly interest in Holocaust narratives is ever growing, the narrative of so-called ordinary people—interviewees of research and documentation authorities, participants in communal memorial books, and authors of singular Holocaust memoirs—have not yet received due attention in this research. Here, I present an analysis of what might be called the central theme of all Holocaust narratives, namely, the narration of rescue acts or events. I analyze twelve narratives told by six survivor-narrators of Carpatho-Russian origins in terms of the relationship they maintain among these elements: dangerous or challenging predicament, narrator's response or nonresponse, degree of</p>

                     <p>Holocaust memory, like all collective memory, is never constructed in a discursive vacuum but within the dominant discourses of a particular religious, national, ethnic, or social community. These discourses determine which aspects of a historical event will be collectively remembered and which forgotten. For example, detailed testimony of Holocaust survivors was virtually absent from the public sphere in both Israel and West Germany until the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, when the dominant discourses in both countries changed dramatically (see Schlant; Segev; Wieviorka). In East Germany—or the German Democratic Republic (GDR), as it was officially called—the authoritative memory</p>

                     <p>The work of Imre Kertész belongs to those texts whose emerging readership and reception faces the question: what are the possibilities and chances of translating such complex prose fiction from Hungarian into other languages? In this paper, I focus on Kertész's novel<italic>Sorstalanság</italic>(<italic>Fatelessness</italic>) and its translation into Serbian by Aleksandar Tišma. My analysis is based on the questions about the linguistic and poetic aspects of the novel that can be transferred into a foreign language and those that can be transferred only to the detriment of the original text.

The answer of the protagonist of the fictional text—a resolute no, also the first word of the novel—is not only a statement of fact but also its transfiguration into an existential decision. In addition to the major theme of this "no"—the "no" of the unborn and unwanted child—Kertész develops a number of</p>

Arendt defined a particular moral phenomenon as the "banality of evil," which she illustrated with Eichmann's own words and deeds during World War II. Kertész created a fictional character in a novel of autofiction and had his protagonist, as well as other characters in the novel, talk and act in a ways similar to those described by Arendt about Eichmann. Arendt's text is a mixture of journalistic report and philosophical essay. Kertész's text is</p>

Although she had already written some short stories at that time, it was only upon her arrival in Israel in 1957 that she became intensely involved in literary work—always in her mother tongue, Polish. Her first publication, a Hebrew translation of a collection of short stories that came out in Israel in 1974, did not gain her much acknowledgment. However, the original Polish version, published in London in 1976, and a subsequent collection of short stories</p>
