      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.</p>

                     <p>The analysis of narrative technique in fiction has generally been considered something of a craft, practiced at times with painstaking descriptive precision and analytic power, and predominandy used in the service of interpretation. Narratology has often been mentioned in the same breath with structuralism, for both aspire to systematic comprehensiveness and attempt to identify and classify mechanisms and structures that generate, respectively, cultural and textual meaning. To be sure, “low structuralism” (as Robert Scholes was to call Genettean narratology) could not have matured in the sixties and seventies without the tradition of close textual analysis inaugurated by New Criticism.¹ Structuralist</p>

                     <p>The distinction between history and fiction is once again stirring the interest of critics.¹ The question seemed settled in premodern times, when history was assumed to narrate the particular and poetry the general. True, until the nineteenth century, history was counted among the belles lettres, but that was a matter of stylistic kinship rather than of epistemological classification. Later, the practitioners of modern historiography became confident that their trade was more scientific than literary; therefore, the attempts to find new criteria for distinguishing history from poetry were welcomed. By then, fiction, or at least some of it, had ceased to</p>

                     <p>Aristotle knew the answer. For him the matter of the division of labor between historiographer and poet was easily decided: the historiographer relates “what has happened,” and the poet “what might happen.”¹ In contrast to Plato’s devastating criticism of literature, Aristotle considered poetry to be of high value. In Aristotle’s eyes, literature dealt with problems of a more general and thus more significant nature, while the historian had to report about specific, and thus,<italic>eo ipso,</italic>less important matters. Aristotle’s distinctions notwithstanding, one might assume that Calliope and Clio paid scant attention to whether they were called upon by rhapsodists</p>

                     <p>On april 19, 1770, the fourteen-year-old Habsburg archduchess, Marie Antoinette, was married in Vienna by proxy to the faraway Bourbon dauphin, the future Louis XVI. Two days later, Marie Antoinette left Vienna forever, setting off to join her new husband in France, and taking leave of her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa, whom she would never see again. That date—“21 April, the day of departure”—headed the first letter in the ten-year correspondence that then ensued between mother and daughter. It is a correspondence that has exercised a certain historical fascination since its first publication in 1864, especially inasmuch</p>

                     <p>Wolfgang hildesheimer’s latest book,<italic>Marbot: A Biography,</italic>invites us to consider questions quite different from those that every literary work, in one way or another, provokes.¹ This is also an indication of how unusual, indeed extraordinary, this book is. But its unconventionality is not without pitfalls, and thus it presents us with a difficult case for interpretation and evaluation. This only becomes completely clear if we put ourselves in the position of a reader fifty or one hundred years hence, when it is no longer possible to set up television interviews with the author, or indeed to ask him any</p>

                     <p>The broadest conceptual framework for this paper is my belated realization that interpretation permeates many more analytic activities than was usually believed in the heyday of structuralist narratology. Todorov’s 1966 distinction between the “sense” of an element, “its capacity to enter into correlation with other elements of the same work and with the work as a whole,” and the “interpretation” of an element, its inclusion “in a system which is not that of the work but that of the critic,”¹ seems to me now to be much more problematic than it did when it was initially proposed. It seems problematic</p>

                     <p>As so often, Lewis Carroll pinpointed the problem long before literary theory became concerned with it: “Begin with the beginning,” the King said, very gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”¹</p>
                     <p>It is, of course, the king’s nonchalant presupposition that “the end” requires no further definition that encapsulates one of the most intractable problems of narrative theory: what is a proper ending of a story, and what does it do to the reader? Since Frank Kermode’s<italic>Sense of an Ending</italic>(1967), the study of endings in novels and short stories has steadily grown in importance;</p>

                     <p>I am concerned with the logic of justification informing Robert Musil’s first novel,<italic>Young Törless</italic>(1906).¹ The novel appears to do everything in its power to ward off moral criticism. It is doubly, triply insulated against it. I shall discuss the various strategies of narrative and persuasion by which the novel achieves a certain dandylike countenance of impassiveness and superiority. I do not believe that Musil consciously set about constructing fortifications around his work in order to defend against scandal, yet it is as if<italic>Young Törless</italic>had in fact been constructed that way. Pursuing its defensive design might throw</p>

Indeed, if socialist realism can be somewhat simplistically characterized as “boy meets tractor” literature, as I have occasionally done in teaching it, the plot of these fantastic stories might whimsically be summarized as “boy meets self as</p>

Its widespread dissemination across the map of European folklore—one monograph identifies several hundred versions of the tale—suggests that there must be something especially attractive or at least compelling about the tale. That it remains popular today, though not necessarily as a bedtime story told by adults to children, means that it must speak to more than one age and generation. Even the brutal and bloody events enacted in the tale did not keep an expert like P. L. Travers from referring</p>

Readers of novels, especially nineteenth-century readers and readers of nineteenth-century novels, have been schooled to seek closure—to overcome gaps, domesticate the unfamiliar, establish connections and coherence, understand motives, and anticipate climax. In<italic>Nana</italic>one can indeed engage these goals, but only at a relatively general level; the text prevents a narrower application of that understanding, despite the personal focus implied by eponymy. For all its proliferation of data, this novel expands without quite filling out a portrait of Nana herself.</p>

Or is contingency one of those points where the enterprise of literary criticism touches on its limits, where it takes shape, precisely, as a reflection on the limits of its own epistemological intention?
