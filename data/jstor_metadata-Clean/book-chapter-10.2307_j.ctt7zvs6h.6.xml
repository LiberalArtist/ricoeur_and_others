      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.</p>

                     <p>Most readers naturally assume that all autobiographies are based on the verifiable facts of a life history, and it is this referential dimension, imperfectly understood, that has checked the development of a poetics of autobiography. Historians and social scientists attempt to isolate the factual content of autobiography from its narrative matrix, while literary critics, seeking to promote the appreciation of autobiography as an imaginative art, have been willing to treat such texts as though they were indistinguishable from novels. Autobiographers themselves, of course, are responsible for the problematical reception of their work, for they perform willy-nilly both as artists and</p>

                     <p>Roy Pascal has observed that autobiography involves an interplay or collusion between the past and the present, that indeed its significance is more truly understood as the revelation of the present situation of the autobiographer than as the uncovering of his past.¹ As readers of autobiography we ordinarily do need to be reminded of this obvious truth, even though Freud and his followers have shaken our faith in the ability of memory to provide reliable access to the contents of the past. When we settle into the theater of autobiography, what we are ready to believe—and what most autobiographers</p>

                     <p>A little boy of seven sneaks on board a train bound for Dijon and falls asleep. Awakened by the ticket-collector, the child admits that he has neither ticket nor money, not even an identity card. To save himself, he reveals that his presence is urgently required in Dijon; the fate of France and even mankind itself hangs in the balance. Like Scheherazade, the child instinctively recognizes that his life depends on words: as long as he keeps on talking, the ticket-collector will not make him get off the train. He never learns, however, whether or not his claim to an</p>

In the fable of the train we are shown a Poulou whose ticketless condition exemplifies his initial lack of justified selfhood, his alienated sense of exclusion from the closed system of pre-existing reality—the Simonnot-like solidity of other selves—into which he has</p>
