         <p>Ranging over 2,500 years of philosophical writing, this five-volume collection of essays is an unrivalled companion to the study and reading of philosophy. Central Works of Philosophy provides both an overview of particular works and clear and authoritative expositions of their central ideas, giving readers the resources and confidence to read the works themselves. These books offer remarkable insights into the ideas out of which our present ways of thinking emerged and without which they cannot fully be understood.</p>

                     <p>It would be a distortion to attribute to philosophy in the latter half of the twentieth century any overall unity of philosophical outlook, and I shall, therefore, not try to impose one. Moreover, the closeness to the present of the works in this period makes it even more difficult than usual to discern a prevailing direction in recent philosophy or identify what value posterity will assign to any particular part of it. If one true observation about late-twentieth-century philosophy may be made, it is perhaps only the trite one of its diversity.¹</p>

Later he was appointed as Gilbert Ryle's successor to the Waynflete Professorship in Oxford. Strawson had achieved fame, like Frege earlier and Kripke later, by writing about reference. In “On Referring” (1950a) he criticized Russell's theory of definite descriptions and claimed that at least some uses of expressions of the form “The<italic>F</italic>” are devices reference rather than a form of general quantification.¹ He moved from this to consider the question of the general relation between ordinary language formal logic, in his first</p>

                     <p>In his classes, John Rawls routinely quoted R. G. Collingwood’s remark that “the history of political theory is not the history of different answers to one and same question, but the history of a problem more or less constantly changing, whose solution was changing with it" (Rawls 2000b: xvi). To understand Rawls’s own work, we would do well to understand the problem he took himself be addressing. Fortunately, Rawls tells us what that problem is:</p>

For much of the preceding half-century, under the influence of logical heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with metaethics (e.g. the semantics of moral discourse), with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the centre of attention. This all changed with the publication of Rawls’s articulation and defence of liberal egalitarianism and Nozick’s libertarian challenge to the legitimacy of</p>

The other enigmas include: meaning and understanding, time and causation, the past, realism, logic, proof, vagueness and philosophy itself. The writings span a considerable portion of Dummett's career - the years 1953 to 1975 - and reflect his diverse concerns in that period. So it would be a to look for and wrong to impose a single theme that unifies the essays.However, two issues stand out as central, recurring as they do in many of the essays.

It is an iconoclastic book. But it is one that any person seriosuly interested in what philosophy is, how it came to be what it is and what it might eventually become should want to read, and re-read, whether or not disposed to agree with its controversial conclusions. In many ways, it is unique text. Certainly, no other book in recent times has launched such a detailed and extensive attack on the presuppositions and preoccupations</p>

Davidson’s central contributions to philosophy are presented in EAE and its companion volume<italic>Inquiries into Trnth and Interpretation</italic>(Davidson 2001b), which deals with issues in the theory of meaning and philosophy of language.¹ The fifteen essays collected in EAE² are divided into three groups: “Intention and Action”, “Event and</p>

                     <p>Kripke first became known for technical work on modal logic, the logic of necessity and possibility, much of it done in the late 1950s as a high-school student, and summarized in Kripke (1963). (Among other things this work popularized a revival of the picturesque Leibnizian language according to which necessity is truth in all possible worlds.) Under the influence of Kripke's later work philosophers have come to distinguish several conceptions of necessity and possibility, in a manner to be described below; but Kripke’s early technical work was not tied to any special conception. Rather, it provides tools applicable to many</p>

                     <p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s Hilary Putnam produced a major sequence philosophical works all directed at criticism of a certain view of the relation between language and reality. Two of the most salient of those works were<italic>Reason, Truth and History</italic>(1981; hereafter<italic>RTH</italic>) and<italic>Meaning and the Moral Sciences</italic>(1978). Both works were independently philosophical<italic>tours de force</italic>and both were enormously influential, producing a huge secondary literature. This essay concerns principally the former work, although we shall often have to refer to the latter also. Putnam is unselfconsciously one of those philosophers¹ who is not afraid</p>

When<italic>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</italic>was published, in 1985, he had already written numerous highly influential articles in the area. He had also written a beautifully concise and widely read introduction to the subject entitled<italic>Morality: An Introduction to Ethics</italic>([1972] 1993a), and had contributed the second half of a joint publication with J.

But it was primarily in the latter half of the twentieth century that possible worlds became a mainstay of philosophical theorizing. In areas as diverse as philosophy of language, philosophy of science, epistemology, logic, ethics and, of course, metaphysics itself, philosophers helped themselves to possible worlds in order to provide analyses of key concepts from their respective domains.
