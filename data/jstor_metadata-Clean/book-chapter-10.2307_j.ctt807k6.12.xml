         <p>The seven contributors to The Mind in Creation bring different critical perspectives -- including historical, textual, and deconstructive methodologies -- to bear on a variety of Romantic authors: Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Together, their essays offer a representative view of the diversity of Romantic studies, from Byron's use of history to Blake's theory of illustration. A retrospective essay by Woodman himself surveys the past and anticipates the future of Romantic studies in the twentieth century.</p>

                     <p>Approximately halfway through book 2 of his autobiographical poem<italic>The Prelude,</italic>Wordsworth pauses to ask a series of questions about origins, personal, poetic, and intellectual. “Who shall parcel out / His intellect,” he writes,</p>

                     <p>“Stop! – for thy tread is on an Empire’s dust!”¹ Thus Byron addresses thereader at his side, forcefully, suddenly, without preparation (3.17). We have no idea where we are. “Self-exiled Harold” (3.16) has re-embarked on his pilgrimage during the canto’s previous, preliminary stanzas, but which part of the world he has now travelled to is still to be revealed. Where is the dust and whose is the empire? Priam’s or Cyrus’s? Caesar’s or Alexander’s? Some Christian monarch’s of yore? None of the above. Byron’s phrase may echo the moment in Lucan’s<italic>Pharsalia</italic>(McGann thinksit does)² when Julius Caesar visits the plains</p>

                     <p>Near the end of book 7 of<italic>The Prelude</italic>are two episodes from Wordsworth’s experience of London, which are presented in parallel fashion and with parallel purpose: the city by night (623–4) and Bartholomew Fair(644–740).¹ They are presented in parallel, in that each descriptive passage is preceded by introductory lines which propose that the scenes about to be recorded differ from those given earlier in the book, such as that of the blind beggar; the difference lies in that “These ... are such structures as the mind / Builds for itself” (624–5), whereas the scenes about to</p>

Sprinkled with cheerful<italic>non sequiturs</italic>and local slang, the fifty-line poem is an amusing portrait of an itinerant pot-mender with a penchant for humming loudly at his work.

                     <p>It has become commonplace to praise Keats as a moral hero, bravely enduring the ravages of disease and disappointment until he makes his awkward bow from the stage of the tragedy that can be constructed from his life. His writing, however, is a different matter, for it offers no cathartic reconciliation. That calm of mind with which he faced his death (“Now you must be firm,” he reassured Severn, “for it will not last long”)¹ is missing from a text marked again and again by passion and uncertainty. Yet these, rather than any faith he may have achieved, may be</p>

                     <p>Until recently Blake criticism has conferred a systematic coherence on his work through a canonical reading that contains the errancy of the early texts by making them experiments with or types of the later system.¹ The Bible, which Blake describes as the great code of art, has been the model by which both we and he have read his secular scripture. Assembled out of the writings of many men, and conjoining two cultures, it provides analogies not only for a unification of the authorial canon but also for a hermeneutics of cultural history that we may now recognize as imaginative</p>

                     <p>What is an illustration, and what must a text be if it can be represented by an illustration? No English artist ever asked these innocent-sounding questions with the acuity and persistence of William Blake, and possibly at no point with more complex results than in some of the large colour prints of 1795. One print in particular (figure 1) stands in a strikingly revisionary relationship with its Shakespearean source, which it treats not as the representation of a perception – as is the case in conventional illustration – but as a field of rhetorical figures which can be detached from their original</p>

                     <p>When, in the early 1950s, I began working on Shelley, among the models I used was Dante’s notion of four levels in his<italic>Convivio</italic>by which, in Shelley’s words, he “feigns himself to have ascended to the throne of the Supreme Cause.”¹ To feign oneself meant to me at the time in some sense to fool oneself. Shelley, I knew, did not believe in a Supreme Cause. He was, as C.E. Pulos has demonstrated, sufficiently a Humean sceptic to question the very idea of causality, finding the only empirical evidence for it in the associational workings of the human mind.²</p>
