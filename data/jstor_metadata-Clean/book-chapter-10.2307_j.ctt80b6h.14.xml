      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Tropes and Territories demonstrates how current debates in postcolonial criticism bear on the reading, writing, and status of short fiction. These debates, which hinge on competing definitions of "trope" (motif vs rhetorical turn) and "territory" (political or aesthetic), lead to studies of space, place, influence, and writing and reading practices across cultural divides. The essays also explore the character of diasporic writing, the cultural significance of oral tale-telling, and interconnections between socio/political issues and strategies of style.</p>

                     <p>This collection of essays looks at the narrative and discursive paradigms of short stories, tales, and short fictions that have been written in postcolonial societies, where the genre of short fiction has enjoyed an atypically forceful canonical role. The book brings together the work of over twenty scholars from Europe, North America, and the South Pacific so as to investigate the practices of production and reception in post-imperial spaces, and to theorize on the relations between genre and space when both are perceived as peripheral. The hybrid forms of Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand writing, for example, demonstrate among other</p>

                     <p>I began my presentation at the “Tropes and Territories” short story conference with the admission that I had written two papers. The first was the one I said I would write – comparing portraits of the everyday in stories by Rohinton Mistry and Eden Robinson. The second – the one I actually presented – came out of my own discomfort with the first. When I read my initial paper, I felt as if I had read it before. I recognized the<italic>pro forma</italic>nature of my original argument. The more I worked through my ideas about critical expectation, the more I found that</p>

                     <p>The tension between these two epigraphs frames my paper. “Home is an image for the power of stories” (Chamberlin). “Can telling a story ever be the same as telling the truth?”(Cowley). What links home, story, and truth? Can we assume that truth is singular, or that it can be reduced to mere information only, as Jason Cowley’s comments seem to imply? Surely postcolonial literature tells us otherwise. How do power, conflict, and the search for truth meet in story, especially in postcolonial and globalizing contexts?¹ Conventional short story theory and criticism provide little help in answering such questions. In privileging</p>

There is no overt statement about why “the very best of South Asian fiction” (dust jacket) scrupulously avoids “local” or “stay-at-home” writers, but</p>

                     <p>How does the very contemporary New Zealand short story enunciate national and cultural space? Or perhaps, to be less grandly ambitious about it, what does the short story have to say to us, in the early years of the twenty-first century, about Maori and Pakeha and the place in which they live. I have chosen not to look at collections of short fiction, the bulk of which are produced by mid-career writers, in order to traverse the bumpier, harder-to-read ground of recent serial publication with its editorial politics and role in the, if not canon, then ‘literature’ formation.

                     <p>It is by the nature of itself that fiction is all bound up in the local. The internal reason for that is surely that<italic>feelings</italic>are bound up in place. The human mind is a mass of associations – associations more poetic even than actual. I say, “The Yorkshire Moors” and you will say, “<italic>Wuthering Heights‚</italic>” and I have only to murmur, “If Father were only alive” – for you to come back with “We could go to Moscow,” which is</p>

                     <p>In Alistair MacLeod’s “The Closing Down of Summer,” Gaelic-speaking Cape Breton miners carry sprigs of spruce from Cape Breton with them “to Africa as mementos or talismans or symbols of identity.” “Much,” argues the narrator, “as our Highland ancestors, for centuries, fashioned crude badges of heather or whortleberries to accompany them on the battlefields of the world. Perhaps so that in the closeness of their work with death they might find nearness to their homes and an intensified realization of themselves” (<italic>As Birds</italic>II).</p>

The ambivalence of the seemingly dichotomous title is reiterated in the organization of the book, which falls into three sections. The first of these sections, “East,” deals with stories taking place in India; the second, “West,” has to do with stories taking place in Europe (Denmark, Great Britain, Spain); while the third, “East, West,”</p>

                     <p>Caribbean literatures have a long history of using Creole in writing, and more markedly in orature, although the scope and reception of this use has varied, with acceptability and more confident practice growing in the final decades of the twentieth century. One of the pioneering and persistent subgenres associated with orality and the use of Creole is the epistolary exchange or series of epistolary monologues, where a persona, often female and using humour, writes home relating impressions of the new land to family or friends, or abroad to inform émigrés of the state of affairs “back home.” The literary form</p>

                     <p>Métis stories are something like the Rigoureau, the shape-changing wolf-man character which often appears in those stories. The Rigoureau is an amalgam of European werewolf legendry and Oji-Cree shape-changer narratives, and perhaps because of this it is a creature of liminality, a dangerous passe-partout, a trickster, a traitor, a folk hero, an outsider. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for the slipperiness of Métis identity itself. I grew up hearing Rigoureau stories, and I was even told once that my Uncle Vic<italic>was</italic>a Rigoureau, but I was never certain that I would know a Rigoureau if I</p>

                     <p>Among the tropes most frequently used in postcolonial fiction, the allegory looms large. According to Fredric Jameson in “Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,” all Third-World cultural constructions are national allegories and serve to contest colonialist representations. Mythic elements have been used for allegorical purposes by major writers from Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong’o to Maori novelist Witi Ihimaera. In his novel<italic>Weep Not Child</italic>(1964), Ngugi notably includes the story of Mumbi and Gikuyu, the primordial Gikuyu parents, anchoring his characters in a primordial setting where divine sanction guaranteed the people’s secure possession of their land (later</p>

                     <p>Thomas King’s first book of fiction,<italic>Medicine River</italic>(1989), is marketed as a novel. It is not a novel. King himself has said that he prefers “to think of<italic>Medicine River</italic>as a cycle of stories,” and he agreed with an interviewer’s suggestion that his first novel has a place in the continuum of Canadian short story cycles (Rooke 63–64), the fictional form that occupies the generic space between the miscellany of short stories and the novel (see Ingram, Lynch 2001). King also claimed that such features as the episodic structure and repetitions of<italic>Medicine River</italic>derive from Native</p>

                     <p>The beginning of R. K. Narayan’s essay, “After the Raj,” spells out his view of the English Empire, of the colonial period, of the language that one might use in reference to it. Although to my knowledge Narayan, the creator of Malgudi, did not use the expression, this essay comes close to defining his “postcolonial” position. He addresses here the craze for the Raj that was exemplified through a number of films, including<italic>Passage to India</italic>.¹ All pictures of India, Narayan explains, are by essence fragmented, piecemeal; and whoever attempts to encapsulate India, or generalize about India, is doomed to</p>

It gradually appeared to her that “that world” – the world of the imagination, dreams, and words, the world of art – was the only possible alternative to her inability to cope with “this world” – the material world of real life, which to Frame also meant the isolating and imprisoning world of the mental hospital.

The motif is particularly prominent in four of the collection’s sixteen short stories: “The Return” (1971), “The Closing Down of Summer” (1976), “As Birds Bring Forth the Sun” (1985), and “Clearances” (1999).¹ Read in conjunction, these stories make up a corpus that roughly spans Alistair MacLeod’s writing life.

Roughly speaking, the stories tell of a real musician’s real daughter and the conditions that governed her marriage; of angels and rumours that fly through the air; of Prometheus’s brother, who plays handball and is stung by “a million dark and furry bodies” (41) after he marries Pandora and she opens the box; and of Ulysses’</p>

                     <p>The “other country” which is conjured up in Alice Munro’s writing evidences a mythic and mystic landscape of origins strewn with aesthetic traces, which belong in the temporal category of the ephemeral, the half-glimpsed, the transient, such as footprints dissolving on sand, or mist burning away in the sunshine. Munro creates a territory which relies on flux density, on energy and forces. Her ephemeral traces are not melancholy, they are cosmic, they move along lines of deterritorialization and reterritorialization that belong in the machinery of desire, on the surface of fluid planes. They repudiate heaviness to suggest the inchoate, transient</p>

                     <p>The short stories of Mark Anthony Jarman’s collection,<italic>New Orleans is Sinking</italic>(published in 1998), are a species of anti-naturalism, where the deterministic forces that would control the narrators and characters (and the author himself) instead furnish opportunities for resistance. For Jarman, the scene of this resistance is language itself, particularly corporate language, which, rather than limiting opportunities for meaning, is used most oddly – in the service of ends other than those for which it was intended.</p>

Recently, Maori and Pakeha have squared off on the beach with less gusto and good humour than in Maning’s account. In 2003 a judicial opinion held that Maori tribes could seek exclusive title to New Zealand’s foreshore and seabed through the court system.¹ The opinion prompted a swift and negative response from Helen Clark’s Labour Government, worried by the electoral implications of further pro -</p>
