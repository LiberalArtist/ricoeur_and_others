      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>A Portrait of the Artist as Australian offers the first critical assessment of Barry Humphries' entire career - as a daring postmodern deconstructionist on stage, film, and television, with sixty-seven stage shows, twenty-four film and thirty-four video appearances, thirty-four television series and seventy-one television appearances, and seventy-two audio recordings, but especially what he calls his "second career" as author of twenty-nine books. With an oeuvre that includes novels, biographies, autobiographies, editions, compilations, comic books, poetry, dramatic monologues, sketches, film scripts, and several unclassified works, Humphries is a literary and dramatic artist of considerable significance. Arguing that Humphries is one of Australia's greatest writers, Paul Matthew St Pierre reveals a multi-faceted artist whose success is rooted in music halls, Dadaism, and his identity as an Australian.</p>

                     <p>“Barry Humphries” are the most appropriate words with which to begin a book on Australian artist, showman, and (especially) writer Barry Humphries. Certainly, they are the most evocative words in my own lexicon, conjuring up the attractive figure of a man of the theatre, a player of men and women not only on stage but also in the audience. Given his versatility as a stage performer, and his elusive personality as a biographical subject (who may reveal himself but only when he is not looking),¹ one might posit various persons named Barry Humphries, a whole company of Barry Humphries.

                     <p>Barry Humphries is an occasional poet. He deserves the designation “occasional” not because he writes poetry infrequently (which he does not), or even because he writes exceptional verse (which he does), but because he has the expertise to write poems for just about every occasion and because he has the facility to do it well and make it look easy. In his acknowledgments he refers to<italic>Neglected Poems and Other Creatures</italic>(1991) as “these occasional verses,” as if his poetry were merely a hit and miss amateur pastime. But it seems it has always been a hit with his audience, both</p>

                     <p>One consequence of Humphries’ first autobiography,<italic>More Please</italic>(1992), was the 1993 J.R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography. As Janet Frame says in her story “Prizes” (1963), “Life is hell, but at least there are prizes.”¹ She should know: winning the Hubert Church Award for her story collection<italic>The Lagoon</italic>(1951) saved her from a forced leucotomy. For Frame the prize had a consequence, whereas for Humphries the prize was a consequence, yet each prize was a take in an Aristotelian absurdity of cause and effect. Whether Humphries’ life is hell, only Humphries can say; but if Jean-Paul Sartre’s character Garcin</p>
