         <p>This series aims at bridging the gap between historical theory and the study of historical memory as well as western and non-western concepts, for which this volume offers a particularly good example. It explores cultural differences in conceptualizing time and history in countries such as China, Japan, and India as well as pre-modern societies.</p>

                     <p>For most academics all over the world the concept of history is deeply influenced by the feature of historical studies as an academic discipline. The world is full of very different manifestations of history: oral narratives, monuments, exhibitions, museums, films, street names, advertisements, not to mention the manifold presentations of the past in literature, music, and the Fine Arts. Nevertheless, at least in the minds of the professionals, history is the realm of the work of the historians. And here we get the impression of a great similarity and uniformity. The professionals all over the world follow similar concepts and</p>

                     <p>The following argumentation is developed in the context of research dedicated to historiography in a comparative perspective.¹ Such a comparison can be easily done within a cultural context that is grounded on the same or at least on similar principles of understanding the past as history. Substantial comparative research and interpretation of Western historical thinking has been done. It is much more difficult to compare treatments of the past that lead to historical thinking in an intercultural perspective. Not much work has been done in this field; and such work as there is tends to take the most advanced form</p>

                     <p>Time and life measure one another, by way of passage, “caesuras,” activities, and experiences. All this takes place within spaces, both concrete and imagined.

                     <p>This is what determines the dimensions of measurement—for units for which constant conditions obtain. Among the Yakuts in Siberia, for example, a “clay pot” indicated the time needed to cook a meal (in, of course, a clay pot). This took a good two hours and at the same time corresponded to the distance of seven to twelve kilometers that a</p>

                     <p>Dimodonko was a small, de facto autonomous Nuba land west of the White Nile in the far south of the Nuba Mountains of the Sudan until 1992, when it became the target of a Muslim Jihad militia, as did the entire territory of the Nuba. The last years before this “ethnic cleansing” constitute the situation I describe here, using the “ethnographical present.” My information stems from a field study conducted in 1975 and 1987/88.¹ The structures I intend to describe existed in similar fashion in the wider area of the southern Nuba; I shall refer to them occasionally, but not</p>

                     <p>Attempting to define the Islamic concept of time, one is confronted with two problem complexes: the relevant theological foundations on the one hand, and on the other the socioreligious strategies that have developed in the process of adhering to the regulations and obligations of the Islamic life order. A consideration of both these areas will contribute to this attempt to define the category of time in relation to its significance for historical consciousness.</p>

                     <p>My reflections on constructions of time in the literature of modernity begin with an ironic quotation from Nietzsche that I myself do not quote without irony: “He who has once contracted Hegelism and Schleiermacherism, is never quite cured of them.”¹ After an introductory section I will start with “Hegelism”; by the end of the text I will turn to the “Schleiermacherism.”</p>
                     <p>In the extensive literature on the problems with time, Aurelius Augustinus is often named as the founder of the discourse for introducing the distinction between internal and external time.² His whole concept of time, which offers, among other things,</p>

                     <p>Since the spread of modernity as a consequence of the French Revolution and the political forms and concepts, the ideologies, and the legal norms it exported, a succession of seekers have set out on a quest for organism, for notions of umbilical immediacy, that is thought to go beyond the arid snares and illusions of Reason, of Jacobinism, of Bonapartism. At the time of the French Revolution and in reaction to it, and after the revolutionary waves of the 1830s and of 1918–1920, no less than after the demise of Communism, voices have multiplied and achieved demotic hegemony, seeking</p>

                     <p>This paper explores the prospects of a proactive approach to historical thinking in relation to the paradox of human difference and interdependence in a global context. The dual premise of my analysis is the reality and permanence of cultural (including religious) diversity of human societies, on the one hand, and the imperatives of peaceful and cooperative co-existence in an increasingly globalized environment, on the other. Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions. But the history of any society would have been mixed, containing</p>

                     <p>Historical thinking has always been at the crossroads; it is never homogenous or unilineal. Thus, the dynamics and the heterogeneity inherent in the writing of history merit emphasis at the outset of this chapter, if only because it is sometimes assumed that history-writing has taken a common approach so far. The initial points I make are, first, that the domain of history has not really ever been rigidly defined. It is not only since Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre effectively broke down some of its time-honored but artificial barriers that history has become open-ended; the two patriarchs of what is</p>

                     <p>It is a truism to say that sources of historical sense generation in a society are not confined to history.¹ The recognition that history’s own established procedures of making sense of the past cannot remain insulated from the influence of ideas and action moving the wider society is growing within the discipline of history itself. This has made the discipline pliable to modes of understanding the past developed in other disciplines such as arts, aesthetics, literary theory and criticism, ethnology, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, and so on.²</p>

                     <p>“Communalism” in the political language of modern India denotes first and foremost the strivings of religious, ethnic, social, or linguistic communities to assert their particularity against the generalizing elements in the concept of the nation.¹ Thus during the course of India’s struggle for independence the communalism of the Muslims in particular distanced itself from the more broadly defined all-Indian nationalism. But other minorities, such as the Sikhs, the Tamils, the lower castes, etc., have also exhibited communalist tendencies out of fear that the postcolonial Indian state would be dominated by the Hindus, the North Indians, the upper castes, leaving them</p>
