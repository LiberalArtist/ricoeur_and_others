         <p>"Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.</p>

                     <p>The International Rhetoric Culture Project has stated in its theoretical outline that “just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric.” The first part of this chiasmus can readily be accepted, since cross-cultural research on speaker performance, memory techniques, social expression of emotion, practical reasoning, and the interrelation between speaking styles and political organization have provided abundant evidence that rhetoric is culture-specific. Extensive research in folklore studies, the ethnography of speaking, and linguistic anthropology have also proved this claim over and over again, the most spectacular cases being the use of parallelism and metaphor (e.g., Fox 1988,</p>

                     <p>A central theme of the Rhetoric Culture project is an exploration of the constitutive interplay occurring between culture and rhetoric—to retrieve, explore, and to make full use of “the ancient insight that<italic>just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric</italic>” (Strecker, Meyer &amp; Tyler 2003). I will attempt to do just that below, take this theme out of the seminar room and conference hall and resituate it—as is clearly required—out in the dynamic movements occurring in ordinary people’s everyday activities.</p>

                     <p>Just as the role of subjectivity in language is attracting increasing attention from an array of disciplines ranging across linguistics, communication, anthropology, history, philosophy, and others, the thrust of this interest appears to be headed in the opposite direction from an agenda that would place rhetoric at center stage. Rhetoric in its conventional guise has been deemed a quintessentially public enterprise, oriented to the marketplace of propositions projected to appeal to others. In the market square of civil discourse, sellers of ideas invite prospective buyers to critically test the proffered wares for plausibility and persuasiveness. In contrast, subjectivity as popularly</p>

                     <p>This chapter sketches a resonance model that bears on rhetoric culture theory in that it deals with “echo chambers” as the substrata on which rhetoric operates. Culture-specific semantic fields reverberate on each other. They bounce back and forth in the minds and feelings of people that share homologous representational backgrounds pre-stressed along probabilistic vectors, i.e., along expectations stemming from previous experiences. Indeed cultures and sub-cultures make available to, and impose to a certain degree upon, their carriers the lexicons and semantic grammars without which they cannot communicate, without which people cannot feel that they belong together. Thus, both constraints and</p>

                     <p>On a beautiful fall day in Cody, Wyoming, Scott Frazier, a member of the Native American Crow Nation, was discussing water and wind. As an educator, he had been invited to speak on these matters at a conference on Native Land and the People of the Great Plains. Mr. Frazier spoke energetically to his mostly Native audience about the importance traditional people place on watching and observing one’s surroundings. He summarized his point through a slowly paced, highly reflective, measured tone, in these words:</p>
                     <p>Listen to the wind or water</p>
                     <p>If we quit listening</p>

                     <p>This blow by the “philosopher with the hammer” (Nietzsche himself) strikes at least two thousand five hundred years in which, after the discovery of the “naked” truth, it was contrasted with merely fictional worlds—and with the consequential demand that they should disappear. Jacob Taubes dubbed this program<italic>Abendländische Eschatologie</italic>(1991) and spoke in his last work of the prophetic dictate to replace “speaking” with “saying” (1995: 109)—the Yiddish “tachles,” or the truth of the word standing here in contrast to the Zarathustra as a parody of the Bible and other works of art. “Poets lie,” say intellectuals since</p>

                     <p>When we reflect upon the role of tenor in culture, we probably think first of tenor as indicating some kind of communicative mood and content that eludes univocal definition. For example, when we witness a heated conflict between persons, and later are asked what their debate was about, our answer could well be: “I did not precisely understand the different arguments, but their general tenor was such and such.” The present chapter takes off from this observation.</p>
                     <p>The dictionaries define<italic>tenor</italic>as “general tendency, general drift of thought; purpose.” They also say what most of us know from school: it</p>

Richard published<italic>The Meaning of Meaning</italic>, in which they advanced a daring challenge to the philological orthodoxy of how words mean. It included, as a supplement, a paper by Bronislaw Malinowski dealing with Trobriand Islanders’ uses of language. Malinowski discussed his efforts to understand the Trobrianders’ language by asking them what a word meant, which he then entered into his homemade dictionary. To his surprise, however, his systematic effort was defied by everyday uses in which the Islanders’ language served pragmatic communal functions, such as gathering women and the elderly to shore</p>

                     <p>A recent fruitful direction in anthropological linguistics has been the resurrection of interest in language’s deictic features, its constant function of anchoring itself in time and space by way of grammatical markers that “gesture” toward reference points in the world (see, for example, Hanks 1990; Senft 1997). We have ample evidence, especially from Papuan and Austronesian languages, of the high proportion of spatial indices in speech. In this chapter, however, I would like to argue from the opposite direction: that it is also spatial and architectural practices that themselves contour and elicit certain forms of speech; that, rather than language</p>

Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, America welcomed more immigrants to its shores than at any other period in its history. As the nation incorporated the new groups, artists and writers responded in ways to help the nation address the changing character and identity of the country. To the present day, the</p>

Determined to convert the<italic>gentios</italic>¹ to Christianity, the missionary pioneers’ first and greatest challenge was to make the Christian message comprehensible to the local population. Apart from the use of images, music, theater, and rituals, therefore, all of which played a significant role in contemporary proselytizing strategies, great attention was paid to the ability to communicate with Indian people in their own languages. Thus, the Jesuits made</p>

I shall give here only an outline without detailed references of the sources. My aim is not just the reconstruction of the concept of the orator, but also its application to problems in modern rhetorical research. In many scientific fields today, scholars speak of</p>
