      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Within the framework of the Forum A. &amp; A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time. With contributions by: Ahmed Aboutaleb, Durre S. Ahmed, Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, Shaheen Sardar Ali, Mohamed Benzakour, Jean-Yves Carlier, Marie-Claire Foblets, Ziba Mir-Hosseini, Fouad Laroui, Bettina Leysen, Rashida Manjoo, Bhikhu Parekh, Mathias Rohe, Cedric Ryngaert, Prakash Shah.

                     <p>We were privileged and pleased to have been given the opportunity, within the framework of the A. &amp; A. Leysen Forum, to invite an illustrious roster of scholars of Islam whose essays are collected here, to Leuven, in 2008 and 2009. From the outset, we, therefore, wish to express our deepest thanks to them and special appreciation for their sustaining support that made the Forum and this work possible. this is the second book in the series of the Leysen Forum. Informed by their several contributions collected in the first bookÂ¹, this volume continues in the same vein and seeks</p>

                     <p>It is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you for nearly a whole evening on matters that are close to my heart as a Dutch politician.</p>
                     <p>I would like once again to thank you for this invitation.</p>
                     <p>the organisers have asked me to address the question of what integration means in (Dutch) society - with the word âDutchâ in parentheses. therefore I may speak of belgian society as well. but if you donât mind, I will limit myself to my own, with an occasional brief excursus across the border.</p>

                     <p>It is difficult to talk about a topic such as âIslam and Politicsâ without first taking a look back through history. For the ideas, convictions and prejudices of today are the results of historical development.</p>
                     <p>Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, died in 632. We do not know whether he left his followers any instructions. According to the Shiis, he designated his nephew Ali, but this is contradicted by other currents within Islam. be that as it may, his father-in-law, Abu bakr, was chosen by the first believers to âsucceedâ Muhammad.</p>
                     <p>butâ¦ in what capacity can one âsucceedâ a Prophet? All</p>

                     <p>Most Muslim societies lack a well established regime of human rights, and the more religious they are, the weaker is that regime. this needs to be explained. the explanation is to be found at various levels, such as the history of these societies, their level of economic development, their inequalities and injustices, their colonial history, contemporary international context, and the critical resources of Islam. In this essay, I critically examine the simple minded but widely held view that the problem lies within Islam itself in the sense that its theology and view of human life are inherently incompatible with human</p>

                     <p>Religious fundamentalism today is not restricted to Islam but is a powerful presence in all religions across the globe. In the JudaeoâChristian world, its rank and file comprise wellâeducated individuals living in, what are in many ways, post modern societies. Reflecting what is today part of a growing critique pointing to a âcultural crisisâ in and about modernity, one way or another, fundamentalism, as Habermas says, is âan exclusively modern phenomenonâ (2001). As such, modernity can be linked to a certain âmind setâ about how we think about self, others and the world at large. The idea of the</p>

                     <p>The works of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na âim contributes greatly to intercultural dialogue and discussion of the place of Islamic law, especially in western societies. His first book,<italic>Toward an Islamic Reformation</italic>(1990), defends a modernist interpretation of Islam that combines respect for the foundations of Muslim identity and basic principles of democratic societies. his latest book,<italic>Islam and the Secular State</italic>(2008), lends broad support to the effectiveness of a neutral State from the standpoint of religion. His works as a whole attest to the vitality of innovative thought within Islam. This also represents a major (scholarly) contribution to both</p>

                     <p>The first part of my title is a play of words on the title of John Bowenâs book,<italic>Can Islam be French? Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State</italic>Â¹. Since the book is not available at the time of this writing, I am not presuming in the least to pre-empt or evaluate Professor Bowenâs argument and analysis. Rather, I wish to offer my own personal reflections on the underlying issues and questions, without attempting to respond to Bowenâs analysis or to any of the chapters of the present volume, edited by Marie-Claire Foblets and Jean-Yves Carlier. In particular, I propose</p>

                     <p>As a London LLM student in the early 1990s I recall An-Na âimâs writing (An-Na âim 1990a) as one of the few then available discussions of human rights not only within the Islamic world, but also more widely in non-Western contexts. At the time, the voice of non-Western jurisprudence, particularly in light of the universal claims of essentially Western concepts of human rights, was hardly heard and, even in the post-cold war period, this field is still not exactly replete with deeper reflections about the significance and relevance of human rights concepts and ideas for non-Western peoples.

                     <p>In some Muslim quarters, there is a lingering, and even increasing skepticism over the universal validity of human rights. those quarters may consider human rights as vehicles of Western arrogance and supremacy that run roughshod over deeply held cultural and religious convictions. Such skepticism demonstrates that human rights are still in what An Naâim has termed âa process of universalizationâ. Their full realization is an aim to which all States have committed themselves, and which is dependent on (1) domestic political willingness and strong institutions, (2) grassroots support, (3) international assistance, and (4) evenhandedness. In order to further universalize the</p>

                     <p>South Africaâs history of colonisation and apartheid included discriminatory laws, policies and practices based on factors including race, sex, gender, culture and religion. the goal was to create a system of legal, social and economic separation of the people of the country. Since 1994, post-apartheid South Africa is a country where many diverse people coexist in harmony, despite differences based on culture, race, religion etc. the Constitution of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 (hereinafter the Constitution) is viewed by many as an ideal model for multicultural democratic contexts, wherein the right to equality exists with the right to culture,</p>

As to democracy, Muslim traditionalists use to juxtapose its mechanisms to the âeternal provisions of God-given Shariaâ. It will be briefly demonstrated that every norm, being derived from God or a human</p>

If they concede but a millimetre to honouring the circus heroes of global capital, under the guise of an â at best two-faced â proclamation of âwesternâ achievements such as freedom and democracy, then I stop considering them as friends; it seems that the mask of culture behind which they used to hide was nothing but a thin veneer.
