         <p>Barcelona: Visual Culture, Space and Power offers a unique approach to the history of the avantgarde in Barcelona, as well as its legacy in the post-war period. It presents the relationship between environment, identity and performance as explored by countercultural artists and communities from the 1960s to the present day.</p>

                     <p>Over recent decades the traditional ‘languages and literatures’ model in Spanish departments in universities in the United Kingdom has been superceded by a contextual, interdisciplinary and ‘area studies’ approach to the study of the culture, history, society and politics of the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds – categories that extend far beyond the confines of the Iberian Peninsula, not only in Latin America but also to Spanish-speaking and Lusophone Africa.</p>
                     <p>In response to these dynamic trends in research priorities and curriculum development, this series is designed to present both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research within the general field of Iberian and Latin</p>

                     <p>The primary aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to twentieth-century Catalan avant-garde movements and groups through a history of visual poetry. This has the advantage both of widening recognition of experimental aesthetic practices beyond Catalonia’s most famous names – Salvador Dalí (1904–89), Joan Miró (1893–1983) and Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) – and of situating their work within the unique and complex fabric of contemporary Catalan culture. Just as a visual poem may be defined simply as an interdisciplinary artistic creation that blurs the distinction between art and text, so this chapter ranges across names associated</p>

                     <p>Either implicitly or directly, the considerable body of published research that now exists in the area of surrealism and Spain variously problematizes, modifies or embodies two potentially contradictory positions that are particularly relevant to Catalonia. The first position is based on the assumption of an uncommonly favourable national predisposition towards surrealism: blessed with a built-in propensity to produce ‘rebellious individualism’, Spain, in the words of Salvador Dalí, enjoys distinction as ‘the most irrational and the most mystic country in the world’ (Dalí, 1990, p. 127), leaving the Spanish themselves ideally placed to make what Robert Havard calls ‘good – or</p>

                     <p>Antoni Clapés was born in Sabadell in 1948. He is one of the most significant Catalan poets of today and the author of more than fifteen books of poetry; some of his most recent include<italic>Un sol punt</italic>(2009),<italic>La llum i el no-res</italic>(2009) and<italic>La lentitud, la durada</italic>(2010). Clapés writes regularly about poetry and experimental art for Catalan, Spanish, European and Latin American publications. In 1989, he founded Cafè Central, an independent publishing house known for its diffusion of experimental poetry. Clapés has many links to avant-garde artistic practices; in the 1970s, he was the promoter of</p>

                     <p>As the Carvalho cycle of novels by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán (1939–2003) illustrates, late 1970s Barcelona had many reasons to be a rather ‘disenchanted’ city. The combined effects of the Porciolista administration (1957–73), and the disastrous aftermath of economic recession had turned the Catalan capital into a rather ‘grey’ post-industrial metropolis (Calavita and Ferrer, 2000, p. 793). This 1970s version of Barcelona as a decaying urban centre was miles away from the fetishized<italic>City of Ivory</italic>conceived by intellectuals of the<italic>Noucentista</italic>period (Resina, 2003, p. 108).

First staged in Madrid’s Teatro Abadía in October 2005 and having subsequently had its Catalan premiere during Girona’s Temporada Alta festival, the play had already collected four awards at the 2006 Premios Max ceremony, including for best play of the season. Penned by one of Spain’s foremost contemporary playwrights, the Madrid-based Juan Mayorga (1965–), and considered by theatre critics such as Marcos Ordóñez to be Mayorga’s best work so far, the play’s origins in sensationalist</p>

                     <p>Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a). By virtue of its very title, Ventura Pons’s nineteenth feature film,<italic>Barcelona (Un mapa)</italic>(2007), would therefore seem to be an ideal object for analysis from this kind of perspective. Indeed, the film’s title appears to point to the centrality</p>

Departing from a simple, accessible exercise like the one above, they initiated a debate on domestic labour, the absence of a room of one’s own, and the limitations their spatial environment imposed on experiencing citizenship. In other words, they both questioned their position as women in society and interrogated architectural stereotypes. As a consequence, they took local action.</p>

                     <p>Àngels Margarit is one of the foremost practitioners of contemporary dance in Barcelona. Her career as a dancer and choreographer dates back to the late 1970s, when there began to be a proliferation of contemporary dance performers and companies in Barcelona (Noguero, 2008; Vendrell, 2008). Although Catalan contemporary dance has not had the same degree of international impact enjoyed by the more hybrid and spectacular performance groups such as La Fura dels Baus and Comediants, largely due to the relative absence of funding and infrastructure for dance in Catalonia and Spain, both she and the members of Mal Pelo (Maria</p>

The city has been conceptualized – as the epigraph, from the<italic>New York Times</italic>, makes clear – around performative paradigms. While all cities, as the director Tim Etchells notes, function in the same mode as theatre, as a model of ‘dynamic relativism … where everything means more than one thing’ (2009, p. xii), in Barcelona performance serves as a mode of conceptualizing self and other, of reinforcing the transformative potential of the city – not insignificant in a city that has re-envisaged its own architectural landscape in the past thirty years.</p>

The chapter will centre on Barcelona itself as a concrete locus of identity negotiation, and on the body as the specific site of that negotiation, through its presence in carnivalesque performance or by its absence, fragmentation or imprint. The body, in particular the puppet body, thus serves as a metaphor for discussing how the accultured</p>

Capital of Catalonia and home to the Catalan regional government, Barcelona is the vortex of debates that question both the Catalan relationship to the Spanish state and to the wider European and world communities. It is these power struggles which will be brought into focus in this chapter, in so far as they have been compounded by the increasingly problematic location of identity in the context of a postmodern, global city.
