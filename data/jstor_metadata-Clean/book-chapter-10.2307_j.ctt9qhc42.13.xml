                     <p>The notion of a ‘crime against humanity’ in international law after World War II led to a revision of the reading of genocides, massacres, mass deportations and dictatorships. The massive destruction of European Jews and other groups committed by Nazism opened the way to rethinking colonial slavery, colonial crimes and politics of segregation within the frame of that notion. There was an increased need for memorials which honoured the victims and their suffering, recognised that a crime had been committed and invited heightened civic awareness and action. The memorial acquired a new meaning in the public space. It was conceived</p>

Thirty years after Pierre Nora made the claim in his magisterial work,<italic>Les Lieux de mémoire,</italic>it is no less true; indeed, the new millennium may be seen as heralding a high point in memorialisation.² This volume contributes to the debates which continue to be conducted around the place of empire in the contemporary life of the French nation, debates that have been underway since the 1990s and that now reach across public life and society with manifestations in the French parliament, media and universities. Remembrance of the past has come to the</p>

                     <p>After the amnesia of the immediate aftermath of decolonisation, France’s overseas empire has become, in recent decades, an object of study amongst French academics, as well as a more accepted part of public discourse.¹ Whilst debates on the nature and legacies of French colonial rule in both scholarly and popular spheres remain contentious, France’s imperial ventures are now firmly part of the nation’s history. Yet, whilst France’s empire may be part of the historical record and, as such, part of our memory of the French past, the same cannot be said for the spaces beyond France’s traditional spheres of colonial</p>

                     <p>The legacy of empire lies quietly under the surface, ready to manifest itself in contemporary French culture, including its literary institution. The history and evolution of one of its minor components, the Société des romanciers et auteurs coloniaux français, reflect the spirit of the times that witnessed its successive incarnations: the rash certainties of conquest, their inglorious loss, the uneasy mix of nostalgia and amnesia, the enduring determination to maintain central influence over an ill-defined periphery.¹</p>
                     <p>Founded in 1926, at the height of French colonial expansion, the Société set itself the mission of defining, promoting and validating a literary field.</p>

                     <p>The inevitable media attention surrounding the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence resurrected the ghosts of a conflict that many would have preferred to lay to rest. For a time the carefully managed official commemorations replaced the silence which habitually covers one of the most painful episodes in France’s recent history, highlighting the contradictions which characterise the nation’s attitude towards this period. This chapter seeks to tease out some of these conflicts, arguing that the events of 1962 continue to resonate within France because they function as a nexus of continuity and rupture, one which marked a moment of watershed for</p>

                     <p>Memories of the Algerian war of independence continue to be a site of bitter political contestation in France where, after a long period of official silence, debates concerning collective memories of the war are voiced periodically in the national media. Historical discourse surrounding the memory of the events of 17 October 1961 continues to prove particularly divisive, with historians differing in their estimates of the number of Algerians who were victims of police brutality.¹</p>

Centred around an interracial family unit, the film explores the effects of (neo-) colonialism on concepts of race, cultural memory and identity politics, proposing contemporary Africa as a borderland in which hybridity flourishes. By foregrounding the experiences of mixed-race women and their families, and examining personal and cultural histories and identities, the film</p>

                     <p>As has been well documented in academic and media circles, Nicolas Sarkozy’s discourse on race, immigration and national identity is one of the defining themes of recent French politics.¹ Less attention, however, has been afforded to groups that may consider it their role to present an alternative view of society. In this chapter, I propose to examine the ideology and strategy of two contrasting anti-racist groups – SOS Racisme (SOS) and the Mouvement des Indigènes de la République (MIR) – in relation to the political climate of 2005–9, a timeframe which encompasses several key events that brought to the surface issues</p>

Largely inspired by the 1998 French victory, a number of significant exhibitions and productions have since commemorated the footballer as a national hero and in particular as a standard bearer for immigrant and ethnic identities in France. The National Library’s 2007 exhibition on ‘Heroes’ enshrined Zidane as a national and global hero, whilst a 2010 exhibition at the Cité nationale de l’histoire de</p>
