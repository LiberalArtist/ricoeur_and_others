                     <p>Until the late Middle Ages the role of the professional Welsh poet by convention and by Law. Poetry and politics were one, and the cultural genealogy of the poet proved the origin of his art in prophecy and divinity.¹ That aside, full engagement with the mode of prophecy is rarely seen in the surviving work of the court poets – or, at the very least, it may be said that the manuscripts (with important exceptions) rarely link the names of these poets with prophetic pieces: the pro phetic ‘origins’ are generally more implicit, more profound, and certainly more intriguing. It is</p>

                     <p>British history is apocalyptic history, and Welsh literature refects this. The island of Britain was – in one tradition – revealed as a Promised Land in a visionary dream to its founder, and human sovereignty was assured on the defeat of the giant Gogmagog, when the island was given it6s name.¹ Prophecy and apocalypse go hand in hand in this foundation legend, and such apocalypse is refigured repeatedly in the literature as the legendary (and perhaps mythical)² sovereignty of Britain is lost and relost, A constant backdrop,³ it takes centre stage in many of the most monumental works, most famously in the</p>

In the following sections the focus narrows to discuss in more detail the trilingual contents of Peniarth MS 50,<italic>Y Cwta Cyfarwydd</italic>, and specifically the works associated with ‘Rhys Fardd’. The evidence discussed is presented in the lists and tables found in the appendices.</p>

Given that there has been no developed study of the rhetoric¹ of Welsh literature, to answer such questions fully would require a far more detailed study of Welsh historiography than the current limited selection of codices and texts.² Such a question does indeed call for a full-scale study of representation in medieval Welsh literature. Predictably, I may make no claim to comprehensiveness as I outline a few ways of reading and interpreting the</p>

                     <p>Reading the<italic>darogan</italic>as an allegorical mode of literature – and one whose allegory is potentially theological – requires a sharpening of the question of the relation of the political prophecy to the eschato logical, and specifically how this ‘political eschatology’ fits into the wider context of Christs’s own return. The crux here is the extent to which history itself which history itself (or a species of history) comes to an end with the return of the son of prophecy. That is, does the temportality of prophyecy, in its collapse of present, past and future, necessarity imply a theological reading or a</p>
