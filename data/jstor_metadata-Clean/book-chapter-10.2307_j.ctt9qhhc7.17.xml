                     <p>Over recent decades the traditional ‘languages and literatures’ model in Spanish departments in universities in the United Kingdom has been superseded by a contextual, interdisciplinary and ‘area studies’ approach to the study of the culture, history, society and politics of the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds – categories that extend far beyond the confines of the Iberian Peninsula, not only in Latin America but also to Spanish-speaking and Lusophone Africa.</p>
                     <p>In response to these dynamic trends in research priorities and curriculum development, this series is designed to present both disciplinary and interdisciplinary research within the general field of Iberian and Latin American</p>

                     <p>Journeys and life on the road have fired the human imagination since time immemorial and inspired some of literature’s most enduringly popular narratives. Film did not escape this attraction, and the birth of cinema itself is tantalizingly associated with recording the experience of being on the move. Early cinema, as Giuliana Bruno has pointed out, ‘envisioned “panoramic views” that incorporated site-seeing journeys and the spatio-visual desire for circulation that had become fully embedded with modernity.’¹ Such connection between mobility and film is encoded in the very titles of some of the new medium’s earliest outputs, from the Lumière brothers’ landmark</p>

Almost forgotten, aged eighty-two, Silvino Santos had been making films since 1913.

Although they are not the only Brazilian road movies of this decade, they are emblematic for the insights they provide into the cinema of the so-called ‘democratic period’ (1945–64) in Brazil.¹</p>

The film follows the adventures and misadventures of a group of travelling artists who go under the name of Caravana Rolidei, as they move around Brazil’s vast territory, struggling to make ends meet, in search of ever-dwindling audiences for their small-time circus act. They first step onto the scene in a modest town in the interior of the impoverished north-east of Brazil, moving on to</p>

This essay examines the relationship between mobility, subjectivity and the construction of cinematic landscapes, spaces and places in this film. The questions that drive this essay are the following: how is the sertão as a space of mobility</p>

                        <italic>Deus é brasileiro</italic>(<italic>God is Brazilian</italic>, 2003) is a road movie comedy set in the north-east of Brazil, adapted by Carlos Diegues from the short story ‘O Santo que não acreditava em Deus’ (‘The Saint who did not Believe in God’, 1991) by acclaimed Brazilian writer João Ubaldo Ribeiro.¹ The film, which takes its name from the popular saying ‘God is Brazilian’ referring to Brazilians’ belief that God has a soft spot for Brazil and looks out for its poor, tells the story of a disgruntled God (Antônio Fagundes) who is disappointed with humanity and tired of his never-ending role</p>

                     <p>When Walter Salles began making feature films in the early 1990s, Brazilian cinema was at one of its lowest ebbs, occupying at one point less than one percent of the domestic marketplace.² Struggling in the 1980s, the industry was completely derailed by newly-elected President Fernando Collor de Mello’s 1990 austerity programme which included a freeze on all personal savings accounts and the closure of Embrafilme, the government agency that had supported film-making since 1969. Any Brazilian film-maker in this period would have needed to go outside the country for work, or at least for international financing. As a result, for</p>

                     <p>The crisis of the national project in the early 1990s, caused by a short-lived but disastrous government, led Brazilian art cinema, for the first time, to look at itself as periphery and reapproach the old colonial centre, Portugal.<italic>Terra estrangeira</italic>(<italic>Foreign Land</italic>, Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas, Brazil/Portugal, 1995), a film about Brazilian exiles in Portugal, is the best illustration of this perspective shift aimed at providing a new sense of Brazil’s scale and position within a global context. Shot mainly on location in São Paulo, Lisbon and Cape Verde, it promotes the encounter of Lusophone peoples who find a</p>
