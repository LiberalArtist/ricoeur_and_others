      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Kathleen Jamie's works are classics. No one can read Kathleen Jamie and remain indifferent or unchanged. Nationally acclaimed since her first major publications in the 1980s, Jamie stands out from other contemporary poets in her exceptional musicality, her strikingly unusual perspectives, her wry humour, translucent imagery, and hard-edged economy of expression. These 16 newly commissioned critical essays and 7 previously unpublished poems by leading poets make up the first full-length study of Kathleen Jamie's writing. The essays discuss all of her poetry collections, including The Queen of Sheba (1994), Jizzen (1999), Mr and Mrs Scotland Are Dead: Poems 1980-94 (2002), The Tree House (2004) and The Overhaul (2012), as well as her travel writing, including Among Muslims (2002), her nature writing, Findings (2005) and Sightlines (2012) and her collaborative work, including Frissure (2013), with artist Brigid Collins. Whether engaging with national politics, with gender, with landscape and place, or with humanity's relation to the natural environment, this volume demonstrates that Kathleen Jamie's verse teaches us new ways of listening, of seeing and of living in the contemporary world.</p>

                     <p>The ‘green and ventricular cave’, where this speaker imagines teaching herself to listen, might also stand for the space where poetry is being read these days – somewhere quiet and removed, one would hope – somewhere the word can still shudder up against silence in the reader’s mind. Kathleen Jamie’s work has been around in the public domain since 1982. She has been the recipient of numerous national awards, and in the past decade, has frequently been in the public eye or ear – in the national newspapers, or on BBC Radio. We are so used to having her around (by ‘we’ I</p>

                     <p>This ‘web of our noticing’ is a significant image in Kathleen Jamie’s work, and the precursor of another web: the one woven by the ‘sulphur-and-black-striped’ spider in her 2012 collection<italic>The Overhaul</italic>.</p>
                     <p>– had you never considered</p>

                     <p>The mundane (‘mending’) and the eternal (‘endlessly’) come together in the last line of this poem, and then the pronouns change. The spider has been speaking in the first person, ‘when I appear to you / by dark’, but now it uses the third – ‘the spiders mending’;</p>

                     <p>At the end of an essay published in 2008, Kathleen Jamie said that ‘wildness’ was:</p>
                     <p>not a place to stride over but a force requiring constant negotiation. A lifelong negotiation at that: to give birth is to be in a wild place, so is to struggle with pneumonia. If you can look down a gryke, you can look down a microscope, and marvel at the wildness of the processes of our own bodies, the wildness of disease. There is Ben Nevis, there is smallpox. One wild worth protecting, one worth eradicating. And in the end, we won’t have to go</p>

                     <p>Kathleen Jamie’s first collection of poetry,<italic>Black Spiders</italic>, contains the words ‘abaheys’, ‘kaffiyas’, and ‘shequel’, but not a word of Scots.¹ Five years later, in 1987, her second collection has just a tiny infusion of Scots words: there’s a poem called ‘Havers’ (‘Nonsense’); someone says ‘“It jist disnae matter!”’; we hear of ‘the Kirk’ (<italic>WWL</italic>45, 46, 47). For a person whose own speech deploys many Scots words and phrases, this poet’s avoidance of the Scots tongue in her early collected poetry is striking. Kathleen sounds Scottish as soon as she opens her mouth; yet on the page in her</p>

                     <p>Speaking in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland in August 2013, Kathleen Jamie remarked that her interest in writing about the natural world began a decade earlier, a reference to the 2004 publication of<italic>The Tree House</italic>.¹ However, the seeds of her ecological sensibility are evident in the 1994 collection<italic>The Queen of Sheba</italic>, which can be seen as the beginning of her mature work. Usually noted for its ‘various forensic critiques of modern Scotland’,² the collection can also be read as a paradigm for the development of an ecopoetics.</p>

                     <p>‘Art proceeds without a map’, Kathleen Jamie has written of the act of finishing a book: ‘It seems to me that if you know precisely what you’ve done, or are going to do, then it’s a project. Projects are not art.’¹ For all her sceptical embargo, the cartographical metaphor remains a compelling way of approaching Jamie’s poetry. Also with cartography in mind, Elizabeth Bishop wrote: ‘More delicate than the historians’ are the map-makers’ colors’, suggesting ways in which the business of cartography, tied though it is to the business of nation-building, achieves a non-political surplus of aesthetic delight.² Access to</p>

The collection’s guiding theme of ‘birth’, figured in ‘February’ as a plenitude of the ordinary, is charged with an abrupt luminosity of extraordinary connection that patterns the animal and earthy, ‘the hare in jizzen’ with the bodily and cultural (‘women’s work’) and other resonant ‘deliveries’ and discoveries of being and birthright (<italic>J</italic>45).</p>

It explores the concept of place with its confluence of political, historical, communal and familial elements, and raises questions around the mythologising and division of land.

                     <p>Jamie chooses particularly resonant words to repeat – among others: ‘unfold’, ‘rim’ and ‘light’. These repeated words prompt</p>

Forms seem often to be calculatedly under stress, at an angle to anything conventional, as in the fine sonnet ‘The Cupboard’ from<italic>The Tree House</italic>(44). In this poem, short lines and an emphatic but unpredictable use of rhyme and off-rhyme keep the poem and reader on their toes, following the twists and turns of a poem that feels its way forward. The ‘cupboard’ is less symbol than wryly presented surrogate for symbolic meaning. Jamie adeptly obeys and departs from the organising</p>

Reconsidering her understanding of the term ‘nature’ in light of these thoughts, Jamie acknowledges the need to conceive of the body itself as a form of ecosystem: ‘It’s not all primroses and dolphins . . . [t]here’s our own intimate, inner natural world, the body’s weird shapes and forms, and sometimes they go awry.’¹ This ‘inner natural world’ is both complex and contingent, and developments at the interface</p>

I am’.¹ Previous critics have picked up on the meditative qualities within Shepherd’s work, where the mountains always remain magical and ultimately impenetrable in her Zen-like reflections: ‘The journey is itself part of the technique by which the god is sought.

This tercet recalls the famous opening line of Dante’s<italic>Commedia</italic>: ‘In the middle of the journey of our life / I found myself . . .’. It must be partly because of Dante’s cultural legacy that this narrative pattern seems so familiar, even to twenty-first-century secular readers: the pattern of a life shaped into two halves, hinged by a critical turning point.¹ For Dante’s pilgrim, the midlife turn leads to</p>
