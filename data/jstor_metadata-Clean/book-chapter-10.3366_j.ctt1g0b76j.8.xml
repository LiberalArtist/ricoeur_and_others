         </p>
         <p>
            <italic>The Ethics of Deconstruction</italic>, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.</p>

                     <p>Why bother with deconstruction? Why read deconstructive writings? Why read texts deconstructively? Why should deconstruction be necessary, or even important? What demand is being made by deconstruction? These are questions which haunt the critical reader who has followed the work of Jacques Derrida. They are questions voiced by the reader who, in pleasure and patience, has read Derrida’s work, but who now, perhaps impatiently, wants to question the demand that is placed on him or her by that work. They are questions, I shall claim, that demand an ethical response, that call deconstructive reading to responsibility, to be responsible. The</p>

                     <p>Following the introductory first part, I delineate in the second part the sense and usage of the word ‘closure’, while, in the third part I trace the genesis of the concept of closure in Derrida’s work to his early readings of Husserl. The</p>

                     <p>‘Bois’ – ‘drink’; understood verbally, Derrida’s final word articulates an imperative, it places the reader under obligation. It is an imperative written without a point of exclamation in the intimacy of the second person singular. It is not directed from a position of height to an anonymous multitude; it is not the impersonal ‘Buvons!’ or ‘Buvez!’, which, in a spirit of exclamation and camaraderie, commands others to join in a toast or partake in a symposium. The imperative ‘Bois’ does not call</p>

                     <p>In this chapter, I follow the path of a dislocation. When Levinas reads Derrida, he renounces the ‘ridiculous ambition of “improving”’ (<italic>NP</italic>89) a true philosopher. Levinas is content to cross Derrida’s path in order to engage him in a philosophical encounter. I shall report this encounter by following the reading that Levinas gives of Derrida, a reading which, while continually transgressing the order of commentary, remains faithful, I believe, to the ultimate ethical orientation of the thinking under discussion. At stake here is the perverse fidelity of a dislocation in the act of reading.</p>

                     <p>If, as I have argued in this book, the pattern of reading that is found in deconstruction can be understood as an unconditional ethical demand in the Levinasian sense, then is this in itself an adequate response to the question of politics? If deconstruction can provide new resources for thinking about ethical responsibility, then does this also entail a satisfactory account of political responsibility? What is the political moment in deconstruction? Can deconstruction provide an account of justice and a just polity? More precisely, as I asked at the end of chapter 1, what is the relation between the rigorous</p>
