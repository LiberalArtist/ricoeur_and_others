         <p>Christian Gilliam argues that a philosophy of 'pure' immanence is integral to the development of an alternative understanding of 'the political'; one that re-orients our understanding of the self toward the concept of an unconscious, or micropolitical, life of desire.</p>
         <p>Through proving its philosophical context, lineage and political import, Gilliam shows that immanence is necessary understanding politics and resistance.</p>

                     <p>It is often supposed that politics operates by way of conscious deliberation and the rational pursuit of an interest of some kind. There are innumerable instances, historical and contemporary, that immediately put this view into doubt. Instances that warrant a closer examination of the nature of the human subject at the centre of such deliberation. It is apparent that in the Westernised world, the working class seldom vote for political parties or pursue political matters representative of their real interests. Indeed, this touches on one of the most pertinent questions of our time: how has capitalism managed to live on</p>

                     <p>In this chapter, I argue that Sartre’s philosophical system instigates the ontology of ‘pure’ immanence that underpins micropolitics and that is carried forward by Merleau-Ponty, Foucault and Deleuze. But is there indeed such a thing as a Sartrean system, a total<italic>Weltanschauung</italic>?¹ This question touches on one of the foremost debates afflicting Sartre scholarship. A number of interpreters have portrayed Sartre as a sporadic philosopher, void of any underlying and continuous ontology or philosophical and political engagement. His oeuvre, it is said, is punctuated by a series of divergent and conflicting views. In particular, with its emphasis on consciousness, Sartre’s</p>

                     <p>Unlike Sartre, Merleau-Ponty moves towards a more direct ontological enquiry into the appearing of the visible-tactile field – the actual – itself, which results in an anti-humanist ontology (or<italic>real humanism</italic>as he calls it) that locates perceiving bodies within a meaning-generating<italic>folded flesh</italic>; a folded fabric of univocal Being that is beyond any notion of a metaphysical outside or internal transcendent Other. Merleau-Ponty’s ‘fold’ signifies a necessary renewal of philosophical language that entirely bypasses dualism in vernacular form, and subsequently any evocation of transcendence – a limitation that plagues Sartre. This serves to both radicalise Sartre’s socio-political ethic of authenticity as an</p>

                     <p>Sartre radically displaces the centred self and begins to reconfigure the Outside/Other through his fleshism. This is advanced by Merleau-Ponty, who in reaching for the<italic>Lebenswelt</italic>as a means to bypass the crisis of modern thought, ultimately provides the conceptual notion of the fold. The fold, in turn, allows us to overcome some of the more ambiguous elements in Sartre’s thought, particularly insofar as his retention of a dualistic vernacular evokes a problematic image of transcendence and therefore remains trapped in this crisis. The remaining issue with Merleau-Ponty concerns his lack of a worked-out conception of force, particularly within a</p>

                     <p>‘Desire’ is an undoubtedly slippery concept, and one that seems constantly weighed down, as it were, by metaphysical, essentialist and discursive baggage. As we saw in the last chapter, it was for this reason that Foucault felt uncomfortable with Deleuze’s use of desire, albeit subverted. A number of interpreters – Žižek chief among them – have since made this the basis of their critique of Deleuze and the micropolitics of immanence. It is essentially argued that by virtue of retaining desire as a primordial ‘micro’ essence or pre-social multiplicity, Deleuze ends up viewing power as a negative force concomitant with the macro</p>

                     <p>I stated in the introduction that my primary aim was to offer the conceptual answer to the question of capitalism’s survival. As is evident, I took subjectivity as my starting premise, in the vein of Marx. Moving beyond the pre-conscious interests of ideology, however, I have sought to provide the conceptual basis for micropolitical unconscious investments of desire. That is, the way in which desire is, though productive, socially produced and managed such that it comes to desire its own repression (capitalism) and/or comes to be shaped in a manner conducive to the continual functioning of capitalism. Conceptually speaking, this</p>
