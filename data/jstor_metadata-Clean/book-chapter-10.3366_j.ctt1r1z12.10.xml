                     <p>Writing about the advent of print technologies and cultures in early modern England, Stephen Orgel argues that “the translation of manuscripts into print constituted the inauguration of an English literary canon” and that “the great originary figures are not Chaucer, Gower [and] Langland . . . but the first editors and publishers, Caxton, Pynson [and] Wynkyn de Worde” (Orgel, 2009, 517). This essay shows that Shakespeare’s early printers and publishers, commonly known as “stationers” in the early modern period, followed by a long line of editors and prestigious publishers from the eighteenth century to the present, have also shaped what</p>

Nevertheless it is always something of a shock to come across, in the greatest poet of the English language, such a memorable expression of the hatred of poetry. Glendower has been wittering on about his supernatural and poetic endowments, and Hotspur has had enough. The bombastic Welshman assures Hotspur he has “framèd to the harp / Many an English ditty lovely well, / And gave the tongue a helpful ornament – / A virtue that was never seen in you”</p>

In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith; or else an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. As human civilizations developed and intersected, translation emerged as a necessary form of communication and a way of life.

                     <p>In the twenty-first century, “Shakespeare” is not only an English cultural icon but shares some of the characteristics of a powerful global brand. This chapter shows the surprising but important role that the many books of quotations and extracts from Shakespeare’s works, published from within his own lifetime to the present day, have played in establishing that status. It argues that these anthologies have not simply reflected Shakespeare’s growing status, but actively helped to construct it. The seemingly inherent qualities for which Shakespeare is now admired – the beauty of his language, his wise understanding of human nature, his Englishness – are</p>

                     <p>Can one learn or surmise anything significant about Shakespeare’s own life from his writings? The film <italic>Shakespeare in Love</italic> (dir. John Madden, 1998) has recently brought the question into focus, even though – or perhaps especially because – that film deliberately plays fast and loose with what we know about Shakespeare’s life. The film more or less accurately places him in London as a young man, eager to succeed in the theatre, keenly aware of the success of his great rival, Christopher Marlowe. This Shakespeare lives apart from his wife and children, having left them in Stratford. And thereby hangs a tale.</p>

Music for Shakespeare meant performed songs and instrumental cues, and musical terms used as symbolic reference and metaphor. Very little music survives that can be identified with a first or early production but dramatic context and descriptors usually provide sufficient information on the type of music required. In <italic>Twelfth Night</italic>, for example, we know that a catch is performed by Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Feste when Sir Toby asks: “Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will</p>

                     <p>For the nineteenth-century French composer, Hector Berlioz, Shakespeare offered more than artistic inspiration. In fact, the playwright and his works acted as a prism through which the composer understood and rationalized his personal and professional successes and failures, indeed his very identity. Berlioz first discovered Shakespeare in 1827, an event he describes in his <italic>Memoires</italic> (1870) with typically Romantic effusion: “This sudden and unexpected revelation of Shakespeare overwhelmed me.

Whether one considers a satyr play, opera, zarzuela, or Broadway show, that work is clearly an instance of musical theatre. Given the frequency with which songs occur, Shakespeare’s plays are themselves instances of musical theatre, but in this chapter I shall be focusing on one narrow branch of musical theatre, the sort of show that is sometimes called the Broadway musical (no Verdi or Elvis Costello here).

It seems sensible therefore to try to trace three narrative strands that have largely determined our current vision of events, outlining the engagement with a Shakespeare who, in his theatrical manifestations, has become subject to a bewildering spectrum of new interpretive practices. Rather than an exhaustive account of Shakespeare on stage during these two centuries, this essay will try to connect, question and extend existing partial pictures of</p>

From the first editions, printed in 1807, to current day adaptations, authors and illustrators have found in Shakespeare’s work ample material for retellings geared to youngsters.¹ This essay will look at the philosophies of children’s Shakespeare, and theories and practices of adaptation over the last two centuries. It will discuss several adaptations by the major figures of children’s Shakespeare: Henrietta and Thomas Bowdler, Mary and Charles Lamb, Edith Nesbit, Marchette Chutte, Leon Garfield, Lois Burdett, Marcia Williams and Tina Packer – along with other, non-canonical</p>

In essence, both types of image are portraits. They attempt to represent a pre-existing entity, whether a real person like Shakespeare, or the people and places he brought to life in his plays. Portraiture is supposedly about verisimilitude, but a successful portrait is less about replicating someone or something in another medium than about meeting expectations. Portraits depict what we want to see or what we expect to see, otherwise they prove unsatisfying. Shakespeare has meant</p>

Once enshrined as a crucial element of national celebrations in Britain, and now often financed globally by corporate sponsorship, festivals represent a development of the Shakespearean franchise, involving issues of internationalism, patronage and access. As this discussion reveals, particular anniversaries are often selected for celebration, supporting occasions that span, variously, the activities of galleries, the repertory choices of theatres and the cultural projections of educational institutions. The uses of Shakespeare in exhibitions and festivals throughout the world, as is argued here, are complementary and point up distinctive assumptions</p>

                     <p>The idea of silent Shakespeare strikes many as oxymoronic. In its muting of Shakespearean drama, silent Shakespearean cinema robs its inherited source of that which most frequently, and perhaps most crucially, has been taken to define it. In effect, the collaboration of this dramatic material with this medium of expression can be read as a liaison of naturally antithetical forces: one imaginatively evokes the image through the suggestive power of the poetically employed word, the other does not just erode the power of the word in its privileging of the image, but all but ousts words from its performance space.</p>

                     <p>From 1930 to 1990, the phenomenon of Shakespeare on film was characterized by a great variety of activity, from landmark “mainstream” films, deferential to textual authority, to a full range of innovative cinematic essays of all kinds, including modernizations, derivatives or non-English cinematic Shakespeares, and transcultural appropriations trading on radical time and space transpositions, such as Akira Kurosawa’s <italic>Throne of Blood</italic> (1957) and <italic>Ran</italic> (1985), which shift <italic>Macbeth</italic> and <italic>Lear</italic> to <italic>Sengoku-Jidai</italic> (“wartroubled”) medieval Japan.

                     <p>This chapter offers an overview of Shakespeare in his cinematic incarnations across two specific decades. It aims not so much at comprehensiveness, for such a project would necessitate a much longer and more intensive approach, but, rather, at a series of critical engagements with feature films that testify to the valences and values embedded in the Bard at a specific historical juncture. The period from 1990 onwards has been dubbed the “Kenneth Branagh Era” and, certainly, there is much to be said for seeing the director, producer and performer – recipient of awards and retrospectives – as central to Shakespeare on film,</p>
