                     <p>‘Prologue’, the opening poem in George Mackay Brown’s first collection, establishes the tone for all of his work to come. One of his most anthologised and analysed works, it places his writing in a context of a wilful nostalgia and parochialism:</p>

                     <p>In <italic>A Calendar of Love and Other Stories</italic>, George Mackay Brown’s first collection, Brown writes of Orkney as ‘a small green world in itself’.¹ Orkney is depicted in these stories as a world and a community that is united by both location and shared religious practice. In ‘Witch’, Brown presents a vision of the ideal community: in a community ‘under God … society appears as an organism, a harmony, with each man performing his pre-ordained task to the glory of God and the health of the whole community’.² In these early stories, Brown adheres closely to the model of community</p>

Linklater calls Brown ‘a recognised feature of Orkney’s landscape’ and ‘essentially a poet of Orkney’.² Brown’s work and personal identity are, from these perspectives,</p>
