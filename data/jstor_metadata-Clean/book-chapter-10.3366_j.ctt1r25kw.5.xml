         <p>This book offers a unique comparative exploration of the role of tradition in Islam and Christianity. In comparing the role of tradition in Islam and Christianity, key themes are explored such as the roles of authority, fundamentalism, the use of reason, and ijtihad (independent thinking).</p>

                     <p>We live in an age when the tired paradigms of public perception reign supreme. Stereotype is all. In this respect, the new millennium is no different from the old. Samuel P. Huntington famously talked of the potential clash of two civilisations, a Western Christian and an Eastern Islamic.¹ The Kosovan crisis of 1999 provided an interesting example of that within the former communist Yugoslavia, with Serbian forces of the Christian Orthodox faith conducting a policy of ethnic cleansing against Kosovan Albanians.² The profound irony of this particular conflict, in the light of Huntington’s prognostication, was that ‘the West’ in the</p>

                     <p>Earlier Western commentators on Islam have had few problems in deploying such terms as ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘heterodoxy’ with complete freedom, as if they were immediately self-explicable. Thus we find Professor Sir Hamilton Gibb, writing originally in 1949, stating in an initial chapter:</p>
                     <p>By this time the pressure of Muslim doctrine and practice had mastered most of the resistances that had, at an earlier time, sought an outlet in <italic>heterodox</italic> and subversive movements. But this did not lead to stagnation. On the contrary, the devotional feeling of the townsmen, grinding a channel of its own, burst the bonds of the <italic>orthodox</italic>
