         <p>The first introduction to writing about intelligence and intelligence services. Secrecy has never stopped people from writing about intelligence. From memoirs and academic texts to conspiracy-laden expos√©s and spy novels, writing on intelligence abounds. Now, this new account uncovers intelligence historiography's hugely important role in shaping popular understandings and the social memory of intelligence. In this first introduction to these official and unofficial histories, a range of leading contributors narrate and interpret the development of intelligence studies as a discipline. Each chapter showcases new archival material, looking at a particular book or series of books and considering issues of production, censorship, representation and reception.</p>

                     <p>In both the United States and the United Kingdom, the field of intelligence studies represents one of the fastest growing subsets of international history, political science and strategic studies. This dynamism is evidenced not only by the vast volume of publications that are generated, but by the existence of dedicated departments and centres, specialist degree programmes, conferences and professional associations. In the US, intelligence is taught at a host of top universities, typically in the form of advanced option courses and special subjects. Beyond this, there are institutes specifically designed to prepare students for entry-level positions in the intelligence community,</p>

                     <p>Where does the history of the history of intelligence begin? As a self-conscious academic subject, intelligence history is widely understood to have started in the 1980s. In Britain, Christopher Andrew and David Dilks proclaimed a deliberate manifesto for intelligence historians in 1984, urging scholars to explore the ‚Äòmissing dimension‚Äô. Broadly contemporaneous with this, the American historian Richard Immerman asserted that it was important to incorporate covert action into any sophisticated understanding of foreign policy. The mid-1980s also saw the creation of the journal<italic>Intelligence and National Security</italic>, edited by Christopher Andrew and Michael Handel.¬π Since that time, we have enjoyed</p>

                     <p>The Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) was the largest and longest of the covert operations run by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Lasting from 1950 until 1967, the purpose of the CCF was to promote an international anti-communist consciousness among intellectual liberals and non-communist Leftists. The CCF established organisations throughout the non-communist world, sponsoring concerts, art exhibits and scholarly lectures to promote anti-communist activism among intellectuals and artists.

                     <p>In the conduct of foreign relations, it represents the option laden with most risk and danger. For many policymakers, it is the least appealing choice. Its raison d‚Äô√™tre is to be inconspicuous to the extent that its very occurrence is in doubt. Some even question whether it is a core intelligence activity.¬π Covert action nonetheless remains the most intriguing, controversial, intensely debated and headline-grabbing aspect of intelligence. Among the numerous agencies that make up the American intelligence community, none has been as closely associated with clandestine activities ‚Äì historically and, moreover, in the popular imagination ‚Äì than the Central Intelligence</p>

Edgar Hoover assumed directorship of the organisation, he used his public relations perspicacity to oversee the careful construction of accounts from hired writers (see Figure 8). During his forty-eight years as Director, Hoover required writers to obtain his approval for access to the FBI‚Äôs internal files. Subsequently, the few writers that dared to craft negative depictions of the Bureau relied solely on outside information gleaned primarily from embittered former agents and Congress; they could not access any of</p>

                     <p>During the nineteenth century, the inexorable acquisition of territories across Central Asia by Russia seemed to menace the security of British India. In response, the British tried to reach agreements with St Petersburg, launched military campaigns to secure their Indian borders and attempted to coerce the Afghans, Persians and Tibetans into protected spheres of influence. The British authorities in India sent intelligence agents to survey, map and monitor the approaches to the Indian subcontinent in preparation for a war that appeared to some, at least, as inevitable. This was the classic ‚ÄòGreat Game‚Äô immortalised by Rudyard Kipling (see Figure 11).</p>

                     <p>Nineteen-sixty-eight was a momentous year for a multitude of reasons. In the wider context of the Cold War, the ‚ÄòPrague Spring‚Äô was underway in Eastern Europe, whilst the war in Vietnam was gathering an ugly momentum. Both Martin Luther King and Robert ‚ÄòBobby‚Äô Kennedy were assassinated.¬π</p>

                     <p>After I retired from daily Fleet Street journalism in 1979, aged sixty-five, I moved home to the quiet West Berkshire village of Kintbury, where I intended to make the most of the nearby trout-fishing and pheasant-shooting facilities. Though I expected to continue as a novelist, with occasional journalism, I thought my days of writing about defence issues and espionage, in particular, were over. Then on the summery afternoon of 4 September 1980, an unexpected telephone call plunged me back into the mainstream of treachery, politics and intrigue with national and international consequences, involving some of the most senior politicians, civil</p>

                     <p>The extraordinary expansion of contemporary and historical intelligence studies since the mid-1970s has been both reflected and stimulated by developments in government policy, as well as academic initiative.¬≤ On the government side ‚Äì and we are confining ourselves here to the situation within the United Kingdom ‚Äì there are two main aspects to this. First, there is the commissioning and writing of ‚ÄòOfficial Histories‚Äô; and, second, the release of documents. One rationale for the UK government‚Äôs Official History programme is ‚Äòto provide authoritative histories in their own right; [and] a reliable secondary source for historians until all the records are</p>
