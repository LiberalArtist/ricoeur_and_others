      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.</p>

                     <p>A western police officer asserts that both rules and her “own value system” are in play in deciding what to do. A western vocational rehabilitation counselor also acknowledges rules, referencing a “cookbook method” of decision making, but points to “what people need” as central to doing her job. A midwestern middle school teacher reveals a clash of values with policy and administration. The administration makes decisions on what is best for the student body, or what the teacher calls “the building.” In contrast, he “deals with faces”—the faces of kids and parents—and makes his decisions on a “kid-by-kid</p>

                     <p>How do street-level workers make sense of their world and account for what they do? These questions guide our inquiry and lie at the heart of scholarship on the state and its workforce. Much of the existing literature converges on a viewpoint of street-level workers that focuses on how they apply the state’s laws, rules, and procedures to the cases they handle. We call this viewpoint the state-agent narrative. We propose an additional viewpoint, a citizen-agent narrative, that is muted in existing scholarship yet prevalent in the stories told to us by street-level workers. The citizen-agent narrative concentrates on the</p>

                     <p>The purpose of our research is simple, even elemental: to collect and examine street-level workers’ everyday work stories to uncover their judgments as they see them. This simple goal belies the challenge of the interpretive task because these stories are often ambiguous and multilayered: they reference both rules and morality to defend decisions, reveal internalized as well as interactive conflicts, and document shifting positions over time. These stories are not philosophical discourses on law or fairness. They are pragmatic expressions about acts and identities and assertions of dominant yet jumbled societal views of good and bad behavior and worthy and</p>

He had a very likeable personality but also a highly explosive temper, and he was very inclined to do as little as possible. Joe, like many of our students, had an unstable family life.

                     <p>Street-level workers care as much about who a person is as about what the person has done. Identity matters as much as acts. By identity, we mean how we come to recognize ourselves and each other through group belonging.¹ All of us belong to certain groups: this is to say that we occupy subject positions. For example, street-level workers belong to various occupational groups and are recognized for their belonging to racial, class, gender, and sexual groupings. Each of these group memberships (for example, working-class, white, female, heterosexual) represents what we call a subject position. Each subject position is filled</p>

So we had all these cases to put on our computers, and of course we were still having to do our regular work.

                     <p>Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level</p>

                     <p>I had a male client who came in for service. He had a physical problem. He was an upholsterer—this was his profession. He had a back injury, and he was having a lot of trouble because he had to lift furniture and a lot of pulling with his hands and arms. I think he probably got a worker’s comp settlement out of it, but he wanted to go back into that type of work. He wanted to know what could be done for him so he could go back.</p>

                     <p>This is an incident that occurred about three years ago. I was working as a detective at a school…. It’s a predominantly white school—I would say 99 percent white. Even [Flores], one of the two suspects in the case I’m going to describe, though she had a Hispanic name, seemed white…. It’s an upper-middleclass school…. Smart kids, mostly kids that are college bound…. The people in this case were no exception. All three of them were pretty affluent…. It was a lot nicer neighborhood than I live [in], with lovely homes and a bunch of horse property, so I</p>

                     <p>This story is kind of an example of—it reminded me of this yesterday because [the vocational rehabilitation counselors] were talking about how in some organizations some people are angry at us because they feel that we decide for the client what they are going to do and we don’t let them do what they want to, and our answer to that is, “Well, sometimes we don’t let them do what they want to because it would not be practical or it would not be feasible.”¹</p>

                     <p>I have known this guy, [John], for probably five years now. He’s a quad. He was one of those wild kids who thought the world was his, and if you drink enough and take enough [drugs]—well, he got really loaded and tried to fly his car over some trees, and it didn’t quite make it, so now he is a quad. The catch is, he still thinks if he wants it, he should get it—and</p>

                     <p>Street-level stories are powerfully descriptive: they take us into the storytellers’ worlds, both real and imagined. Through the storytellers’ words, we experience the physical and emotional context of their work. We meet the students, clients, criminals, victims, bystanders, coworkers, and bosses who populate these story worlds. Street-level stories, like other narratives both grand and mundane, help us understand how sense and meaning are made and how norms are conveyed and enforced. Whether the story is of Odysseus on his mythic voyage or a voc rehab counselor confronting a difficult client, stories reveal moral reasoning as the storyteller navigates through the</p>
