         <p>In<italic>Strung Together: The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary,</italic>Sean Miller examines the cultural currency of string theory, both as part of scientific discourse and beyond it. He demonstrates that the imaginative component of string theory is both integral and indispensable to it as a scientific discourse. While mathematical arguments provide precise prompts for physical intervention in the world, the imaginary that supplements mathematical argument within string theory technical discourse allows theorists to imagine themselves interacting with the cosmos as an abstract space in such a way that strings and branes as phenomena become substantiated and legitimized. And it is precisely this sort of imaginary-which Miller calls a<italic>scientific imaginary</italic>-duly substantiated and acculturated, that survives the move from string theory technical discourse to popularizations and ultimately to popular and literary discourses. In effect, a string theory imaginary legitimizes the science itself and helps to facilitate a virtual domestication of a cosmos that was heretofore remote, alien, and incomprehensible.</p>

                     <p>String theory is reputed to have begun in 1968, when a postdoctoral fellow named Gabrielle Veneziano, working at CERN,¹ one of the world’s leading high energy physics laboratories, proposed a solution to a vexing problem concerning the interaction of subatomic particles in the nuclei of atoms. He accomplished this by using a formula he had found in an eighteenth-century mathematics text.² Two years later, three other theorists—Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen—independently suggested that Veneziano’s redeployment of this antique mathematical function implied that the particles that formed the nuclei of atoms were not actually zero-dimensional point-particles, but</p>

He wore a tight leather motorcycle jacket with no visible shirt underneath and had a Rod Stewart haircut. He liked to party, he told me, and was ready to go out and party hard, but because he’d lost his license for various reasons he had no car and his cab had not yet arrived. So, sure, he’d be happy to share his views with me. I took out my recorder.</p>

                     <p>The previous chapter surveyed the expository portion of certain representative texts in string theory technical discourse in their development of a scientific imaginary. The content of this exposition is best understood as an imaginary because it is primarily concerned with substantiating an abstract theoretical space as that which is natural. Theorists attempt to expose this abstract theoretical space as something physically coherent by means of a procedural space that intersects with the theoretical space. At the nexus of theoretical and procedural spaces, what the theorists construct gives way to an encounter with natural phenomena in the form of the strings</p>

                     <p>The previous chapter investigated the ways in which a selection of string theory popularizations makes an abstract theoretical space accessible through a pedagogical space. Within these string theory popularizations access becomes an imaginative mode that works to distinguish what theorists mark as novel in that space; in particular, images of strings and branes, from what the theorists frame as established yet incomplete knowledge of the cosmos. But on closer scrutiny, this novel string theoretical imaginary betrays, like the exposition within string theory technical discourse, its own incoherences. A radical heterogeneity arises from the way popularizations blend a multitude of string</p>

                     <p>As with many, I first encountered string theory when I picked up a copy of Brian Greene’s popularization,<italic>The Elegant Universe,</italic>in 1999. Having at the time a passing familiarity with the counterintuitive idiosyncrasies of quantum theory, I was drawn to it by the prospect of discovering further strangeness lurking in the remotest recesses of the subatomic universe. Thus captivated by what I took to be the astonishing ideas of string theory itself, I paid little attention to the manner in which those ideas were expressed. In effect, I was not entirely cognizant of the book’s patently romantic undertone. It</p>
