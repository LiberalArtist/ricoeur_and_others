         <p>The need for informed analyses of health policy is now greater than ever. The twelve essays in this volume show that public debates routinely bypass complex ethical, sociocultural, historical, and political questions about how we should address ideals of justice and equality in health care. Integrating perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and public health, this volume illuminates the relationships between justice and health inequalities to enrich debates.<italic>Understanding Health Inequalities and Justice</italic>explores three questions: How do scholars approach relations between health inequalities and ideals of justice? When do justice considerations inform solutions to health inequalities, and how do specific health inequalities affect perceptions of injustice? And how can diverse scholarly approaches contribute to better health policy? From addressing patient agency in an inequitable health care environment to examining how scholars of social justice and health care amass evidence, this volume promotes a richer understanding of health and justice and how to achieve both.The contributors are Judith C.

                     <p>Across the globe and within local communities, people suffer from disease, disability, and early mortality at vastly different rates from one another. Some of these differences, such as those that stem from impoverished environmental conditions or a lack of access to health care, strike many observers as unjust; others, such as those that reflect choices to engage in potentially dangerous elite sports, may seem to have little to do with justice. How we understand the relationship between health inequalities and justice is influenced by many factors, including notions of deservingness, choice, vulnerability, luck, cultural and familial practices, and social group</p>

                     <p>Over the past two and a half decades, distinct approaches have been taken to defining and measuring health inequalities or disparities and health equity. Some efforts have focused on technical issues in measurement, at times without addressing the implications for the concepts themselves and how that might influence action. Others have focused on the concepts, sometimes without adequately addressing the implications for measurement. This chapter contrasts a few different approaches, examining their conceptual bases and the implications for measurement and policy. It argues for an approach to defining health inequalities and health equity that centers explicitly on notions of justice</p>

                     <p>Moral philosophers have for some time been arguing that global poverty and associated human suffering are universal concerns, and that there is a moral obligation, not just a matter of charity, for wealthier countries to do more to alleviate global poverty. The scope of this moral concern is the topic of considerable debate, and it is unclear to many that this obligation is grounded in justice, rather than in humanitarian duties to foreigners. In this chapter I suggest that if we are serious about addressing the problem of global health inequalities, we need to develop a better conception of global</p>

                     <p>If one wishes to evaluate inequalities in health from the perspective of justice, it is natural to turn to philosophical conceptions of egalitarianism. Such views aim to explain why inequalities (or at least certain inequalities) are morally problematic, and why social and political institutions that engender inequalities are unjust and need repair. There is, however, a vigorous debate within political philosophy as to how egalitarianism should be conceived. In recent years, a broad division has emerged between so-called luck egalitarians, on the one hand, and “relational” egalitarians, on the other. The main aim of this chapter is to explain this</p>

The risk factors—smoking, poor diet, inactivity, obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and stress—are all more common among the less educated and less affluent, the same group that research has shown is less likely</p>

                     <p>Epidemiological reports consistently show that Latino children have worse oral health than African American and white children. Among Latino subgroups, Mexican American children have the highest mean number of decayed teeth and unfilled cavities. While acknowledging barriers to receipt of dental treatment, the dental public health literature tends to zero in on Mexican immigrant parents as the primary cause of their children’s poor health outcomes. It portrays immigrant caregivers as “bad parents,” suggesting that they frequently put their children to bed with sweetened beverages (Shiboski et al. 2003) and fail to take their children for preventive dental checkups (Scott and</p>

                     <p>Conceptions of risk raise issues of profound moral significance. Since the notion of risk always involves concern with possible harm (of whatever variety—not all harms are physical) or compromise of a person’s or group’s good, bioethicists tend to think about questions of risk as matters of beneficence. However, we will argue that beneficence does not exhaust the moral significance of risk—that conceptions of risk also raise issues of social justice. In itself, this is a noteworthy deviation from typical understandings of the application of the canonical principles of bioethics. Our analysis thus dovetails with that provided by Eva</p>

                     <p>Posing questions about justice and inequality in the realm of mental health services opens up two very different lines of analysis. A long tradition of social epidemiology demonstrates the disproportionate burden of mental illness associated with poverty, migration, and membership in stigmatized ethnic and racial groups (Ngui et al. 2013; Kessler et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2012).¹ This approach begins with objective epidemiological data and then launches a normative argument about the psychiatric sequelae of social injustice. The inequalities documented in this literature arise from large-scale social arrangements, including class hierarchy, global imbalances of resources and opportunities, and symbolic</p>

Any plausible theory of justice needs … data provided by social and biomedical researchers who seek to understand how complex social and economic relationships affect health and other essential dimensions of well-being” (Powers and Faden 2006, 193). With respect to their own theory, they argue:</p>
