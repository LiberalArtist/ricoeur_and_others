         <p>"The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M. Morrison, Catherine Naji, Justine Sarrot, Liz Stanley, Ursula Tidd, and Veronique Zaytzeff</p>

                     <p>It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to honor the monumental work of research and publication that the Beauvoir Series represents, which was undertaken and brought to fruition by Margaret A. Simons and the ensemble of her team. These volumes of Simone de Beauvoir’s writings, concerning literature as well as philosophy and feminism, stretch from 1926 to 1979, that is to say throughout almost her entire life. Some of them have been published before, and are known, but remain dispersed throughout time and space, in diverse editions, diverse newspapers or reviews. Others were read during conferences or radio programs</p>

                     <p>This volume of literary writings by Simone de Beauvoir (1908–86), the renowned French existentialist author of<italic>The Second Sex</italic>, opens with a drama. Beauvoir wrote her 1945 play,<italic>The Useless Mouths</italic>, during the final year of the Nazi Occupation of France when food shortages were acute. Her story of the anguish of choice for a besieged medieval town facing starvation is also a surprisingly feminist tale of courageous women who stare down death and inspire the male leaders of the town to do the same.</p>

                        <italic>Les bouches inutiles</italic>(<italic>The Useless Mouths</italic>), Simone de Beauvoir’s only play, opened with a benefit performance on October 29, 1944, at the Théâtre des Carrefours.² It has considerable importance for understanding Beauvoir’s writing, the development of her philosophical ideas particularly. However, as Virginia Fichera has pointed out, “Although it is a major work exploring the relationship between sex and gender predating<italic>The Second Sex</italic>by about four years, unfortunately it has been neglected by critics and scholars of her work.³ The play deals with the ethical consequences of treating some people as worthless and useless, something still of considerable social</p>

                     <p>For a year now there have been some rather considerable changes in the French press. It is truly regrettable that in glancing through the newspaper columns devoted to theatrical critiques, one might think one has been transported back to the time when Alain Laubreaux and the like systematically strove to muddle values, destroying any strong and great work with their insults.¹ It seems they have, alas, created a tradition. This outrage is what one discovers when reading the articles written in reaction to the presentation of<italic>King Lear</italic>.²</p>

                     <p>The novel and the theater are two forms of fiction: in both cases, it is a matter of creating an imaginary world, and making characters, whose story constitutes what is called the plot, enter into this world. In order for the impact of the work to surpass that of simple entertainment, the story must also have a signification. Through carefully constructed lies, the book, like the play, strives to communicate a general human truth, but they do not rely on the same devices, and they do not seek the same type of truth.</p>

                     <p>Today in France they frequently say that the novel is dying, that the novel is dead. That is one of the leitmotivs of postwar criticism. Nevertheless, if you loiter by the bookshop windows, or prowl among the editors’ offices, you cannot help being struck by the great number of books and manuscripts that flaunt the label “novel.” Nor are they dead works, for many of them are received by the public with enthusiasm. The critics cannot ignore this fact, but they nevertheless shake their heads and mutter, “These are not true novels. The novel is dead.” You might be tempted</p>

Still, little critical attention continues to be paid to Beauvoir’s relationship to theater, admittedly a small portion of her creative activity with<italic>Les bouches inutiles</italic>(<italic>The Useless Mouths</italic>) as her only play, and even less to her ideas on theater.¹ Until recently, Beauvoir’s theoretical interest in the genre as both a written and a</p>

                     <p>I have chosen the two authors that seem to be the most representative: Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus, who had never published theatrical works before the war, and who are very indicative of the tendencies of modern theater.¹ And among their plays, I chose<italic>The Flies</italic>and</p>

To make being ‘be’ is to communicate with others by means of being.”¹ However, for most of her intellectual career, literature was Beauvoir’s preferred means for carrying out the philosophical task of disclosing being in a communicable, communicative way. As she argued in a series of essays and public lectures between the 1940s and 1960s, literature is better equipped to present the qualitative</p>

                     <p>When Simone de Beauvoir undertook a lecture tour of Japan with Sartre in the autumn of 1966 she had long been a writer with a substantial international reputation. She had published four novels and three volumes of her autobiography, as well as<italic>Le deuxième sexe</italic>(<italic>The Second Sex</italic>) and a number of other philosophical essays. All her major work had been translated into Japanese, and the Japanese translation of<italic>Le deuxième sexe</italic>had been a best seller only the previous year. Beauvoir has described in her memoirs the warmth of the welcome that she received from her Japanese readers.¹ The</p>

                     <p>Jean-Paul Sartre spoke to you about literature in general. He told you what all writers have in common; for them it is a question of communicating “the lived sense of being-in-the-world” by giving as a product an object which is a singular universal: their oeuvre.¹</p>
                     <p>In order to round off his talk, I thought that it would be interesting to choose a specific example, and I chose the one that I know the best, my own. So I am going to speak to you, along the lines laid out by Jean-Paul Sartre, of my own undertaking, of my own experience</p>

                     <p>The stories you are about to read were written down in France, nearly three hundred years ago, by a very learned old gentleman. He wore a white wig, and his name was Charles Perrault.¹ He didn’t make up the stories himself, though. They were already old when he found them, so old that no one can tell their age. What is more, they had traveled by word of mouth so far around the globe—from Ireland to India, and all through Europe and Asia—that no one is sure where they first started. A thousand years ago in China, grandmothers</p>

                     <p>So often of late, while walking through this new Paris of freshly whitened façades where a stream of traffic flows along the road between hedges of parked cars, I find myself pausing to ask: What did all this look like in the days when I was young? How I longed to bring back from memory a picture as vivid as one of the illustrations in<italic>Votre Maison</italic>,¹ the old farmhouse transformed into an elegant villa—before and after. This desire of mine was suddenly fulfilled when the photographs Gisèle Freund made during the thirties were placed in my hands.²</p>

                     <p>This book is the true story of a youth that is consumed in a potash mine in Alsace twenty years ago.¹ With fascinating precision, it introduces us to the techniques of an exhausting and dangerous job that—at least to my knowledge—has never been described. But its value surpasses, and by far, that of a simple document. In a darkly passionate tone, the author reconstitutes an entire human experience for us—the experience of a “wood-louse of a man who scrapes at the salt nine hundred meters down.” He tells us of his fatigue, his fear, his resignation, his</p>

True, each chapter begins with a summary of world events, but the author does not see History as the upheavals reported in newspapers and described in books. For Morante, History is the hidden repercussion of these events in the hearts and bodies of the anonymous individuals who suffer through them, usually without understanding what is taking place.</p>

                     <p>“In my young days, I wrote a great deal: but nothing that seemed worthwhile to me,” wrote Simone de Beauvoir in 1979, introducing her earliest completed novel manuscript when it appeared as<italic>Quand prime le spirituel</italic>— almost forty years after Gallimard and Grasset had rejected it.² And when biographer Deirdre Bair asked her about a “collection of loose papers dating from 1928,” which appears to include at least part of the manuscript you are about to read, she responded (according to Bair) “I am astonished . . . I wrote little more then than crude, confused blunderings, all of which</p>
