      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>An attempt to put an Asian woman on Canada's $100 bill in 2012 unleashed enormous controversy. The racism and xenophobia that answered this symbolic move toward inclusiveness revealed the nation's trumpeted commitment to multiculturalism as a lie. It also showed how multiple minor publics as well as the dominant public responded to the ongoing issue of race in Canada. In this new study, Christine Kim delves into the ways cultural conversations minimize race's relevance even as violent expressions and structural forms of racism continue to occur. Kim turns to literary texts, artistic works, and media debates to highlight the struggles of minor publics with social intimacy. Her insightful engagement with everyday conversations as well as artistic expressions that invoke the figure of the Asian allows Kim to reveal the affective dimensions of racialized publics. It also extends ongoing critical conversations within Asian Canadian and Asian American studies about Orientalism, diasporic memory, racialized citizenship, and migration and human rights. An original reconsideration of foundational concerns, The Minor Intimacies of Race focuses on the ephemeral and the nuanced to reveal the social hierarchies and power structures inherent in today's North America.</p>

                     <p>On November 14, 2011, the Bank of Canada launched into circulation a new $100 bill made of polymer as part of a broader project to overhaul Canadian currency. This new currency series—like the two that preceded it in 1969–79 and 1986—was publicized as bearing increased security features that would be difficult to counterfeit, news welcomed by many Canadians. While the upgrading of banknotes is a routine occurrence, this particular one became the subject of controversy nearly a year later when several news outlets revealed that, during the design process for this new banknote, the bank’s focus groups</p>

                     <p>In this chapter, I interrogate Canadian perceptions of multiculturalism in order to contextualize the demands that two contemporary Asian Canadian texts, Cindy Mochizuki’s section of Vancouver-based theater company Theatre Replacement’s<italic>Bioboxes</italic>(2007) and Joy Kogawa’s novel<italic>The Rain Ascends</italic>(1995, 2003), levy on the multicultural nation. In this instance, multiculturalism as a regulatory matrix becomes recognizable through the subjects it simultaneously imagines and fails to recognize in practice. The first part of this chapter uses Theatre Replacement’s production<italic>Bioboxes</italic>to examine how an Asian Canadian insistence on social intimacy reshapes the ideals of multiculturalism. The second section of this discussion</p>

                     <p>Between the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011, two texts ignited fiery debate about race in Canadian and American postsecondary institutions. The first was “Too Asian?,” an article published in the print and online versions of<italic>Maclean’s</italic>(which bills itself as Canada’s national magazine) in November 2010. In it, Stephanie Findlay and Nicholas Kohler use anecdotal evidence to examine how race relations within Canadian universities contribute to the reputations of specific schools and the overall climate of postsecondary institutions. Their central claim is that many high school students avoid attending universities perceived as “too Asian” because that would</p>

At the beginning of the novel, we are told that Andrei has disappeared without a word, leaving Naiko both grief-stricken and unsure about what to do with the bits of story that he has confided in her. The text’s premise underscores a link between the task of remembering and the material objects</p>
