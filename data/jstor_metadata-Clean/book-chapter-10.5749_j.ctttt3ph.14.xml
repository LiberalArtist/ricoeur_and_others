         <p>Rethinking the importance of Sigmund Freud's landmark book The Interpretation of Dreams a century after its publication in 1900, this work brings together psychoanalysts, philosophers, cultural theorists, film and visual theorists, and literary critics in a compilation of the best clinical and theoretical work being done in psychoanalysis today.

                     <p>Initially it may seem strange to suggest that dreams contain ethical standards, as they often stage violence, murder, and perverse situations. To move beyond this apparent contradiction it is necessary to make the distinction between ethics and morals. Samurai warriors, gangsters, and politicians all possess ethical ideals dictating their codes of conduct. Both the gangster and the Samurai have codes of conduct based on the ethical standards of the groups with which these figures are affiliated. (In the case of politicians, this affirmation is less certain.) For example, a Samurai who chooses to commit<italic>Hara Kiri</italic>does so in accordance</p>

                     <p>In a dense passage of<italic>Nadja</italic>, André Breton puzzles out a complex sequence of factors that account for his inexplicable fascination with a terrible play. Admitting that a bad melodrama entitled Les<italic>Détraquées</italic>had made a powerful impression on him, he narrates a disturbing dream he had at the time. The dream’s climax came when a moss-colored insect about twenty inches long slipped down into his throat until it was pulled out of his mouth by its huge hairy legs. Meditating on the nausea this still triggers in him, Breton tries to generalize, reflecting on the links between dreams and</p>

                     <p>Even as he maintains remarkable rigor in his search for the validation of his clinical practice, Freud does not entirely subscribe to a certain conception of science—in particular, to the conception of experimental science. Nevertheless the knowledge (<italic>le savoir,</italic>thus translated passim) of psychoanalysis Freud invents only presents itself in experience. With dreams Freud claims that a space other than the one defined by neuronal, synaptic, electrical, or chemical interconnections, and other than the imaginary, traverses, in both man and animal, the psychical apparatus regulating them. This is a space where, among other activities he will attempt to define,</p>

                     <p>Fully immersed in a book I was writing on hysteria in the Puerto Rican ghetto, I chanced upon historical material about the colonial history of the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. It was in that connection that I reopened the pages of<italic>The Interpretation of Dreams</italic>in which Freud describes one of his most peculiar dreams, a dream of a castle by the sea, a dream of naval war, too, a complex narrative dealing with the Spanish-American War (SE V, 463-64) . This was the war that ended with the annexation of Puerto Rico by the</p>

                     <p>Ever resisting the temptation to be born again, even today, as we mark the one-hundredth anniversary of its initializing text, psychoanalysis was from the start just about the only one to confront human cruelty, the punishing aspects of the psyche, without a theological alibi—in fact, with no alibi or safety net. Psychoanalysis ventured forth without an alibi—with no excuse, as it were. This is one of Derrida’s recent themes: that psychoanalysis met head-on with unbearable examples of suffering, but took no recourse to theology. It may have scanned monotheism, or even served as witness for Dr. Schreber when</p>

                     <p>The Devil has two points of entry in Freud’s science. He is along for the aside in which Freud, in your dreams, addresses philosophy and music. But then he also takes center stage when Freud analyzes cases of possession, in delusions and in dreams. The Devil of possession belongs to the rehearsal stage of Oedipal plot developments when father is your bosom body. In addition to the pre-Oedipal or phallic mother and the Oedipal father or parent, there is a pre-Oedipal father, the primal father in everyone’s development, the one who, through monopolization of sexual difference or sexuality, gives rise</p>

                     <p>One of the major conclusions of Freud’s<italic>The Interpretation of Dreams</italic>is, of course, that every dream comes down to the fulfillment of a secret wish. This is the main message of Freud’s book, the one that has been kept intact for the last hundred years. The latent dream thoughts contain a forbidden unconscious desire, which finds its expression in the manifest dream content, albeit in a distorted way due to the dream-work. Every analysis has to follow the opposite road, meaning that the dream-work has to be countered by the analytic work. At the end of the analytic day,</p>

Freud’s unconscious is a seductive delinquent, always on the go, tracking down desire and its infinite partial objects. Oblivious to debts, to logic and justice, it moves steadily toward death in search of the intervention of a father figure in front of whom it refuses to yield. No wonder that, among Freud’s epigones, Lacan stands quasi-alone to plead for that which defies the proper functioning of the law of social and</p>

Yet it is striking to observe that the psychoanalytic literature of the past fifty years virulently challenges the Freudian model—<italic>Vorbild</italic>—of the dream and the transference. We are actually witnessing a perplexing evolution characterized by the always more profound denial of the very essence of the Freudian discovery and its foundation—namely, the existence of the images created by autoerotic sexuality, i.e., the unconscious (infantile) images—<italic>Bild[er]</italic>—that shape the dream as well as the neurotic symptom, and even psychosis.

                     <p>The year 1895 is key in the history of psychoanalysis and cinema.

                     <p>This essay is part of a larger project in which I try to trace certain links in twentieth-century thought among thinkers such as Freud, Deleuze, Benjamin, Heidegger, and Blanchot. I introduce my theme by referring to Foucault’s 1970 essay on Deleuze, “Theatrum Philosophicum.” Here Foucault writes that the most important question for philosophy now, as Deleuze shows us, is the relation between thought and non-thought, or stupidity. Thinking is therefore an<italic>act</italic>in the double sense of the word. It is first of all an act of giving birth to itself, from<italic>and</italic>in relation to stupidity. The act of</p>

                     <p>The withdrawal of stimuli coming from the external world, and which Freud deemed necessary to the onset of sleep, entails, according to Otto Isakower, a phenomenon that occurs in some people at the moment just prior to falling asleep.¹ In his descriptions Isakower notes how this “falling” reveals a subjective destitution, and how the subject later reencounters itself as an object in the dream scene. This phenomenon consists of sensations that imply the dissolution of the corporeal limits between the inside and the outside, a loss of corporeal integrity, and a predominance of the oral zone. In his text Isakower</p>

                     <p>“Most prominent among [the] formal characteristics, which cannot fail to impress us in dreams,” Freud asserts, are the “differences in intensity” within them (SE IV, 329). Freud notes that “differences in intensity between particular dream-images cover the whole range extending between a sharpness of definition which we feel inclined, no doubt unjustifiably, to regard as greater than that of reality and an irritating vagueness which we declare characteristic of dreams because it is not completely comparable to any degree of indistinctness which we ever perceive in real objects” (SE IV, 329).

                     <p>A staple of documentary cinema from its earliest days, the interview may be the one situation in cinema where vision is redundant. The power of the interview as a documentary technique has primarily to do with the temporal continuity between the event and its cinematic representation embodied in the interview subject’s voice. The synchronous recording of sound and sight in the documentary interview presents us, then, with another instance of the confrontation of the look and the gaze in cinema. To the viewer, this gaze takes the form of a question that can never be articulated: if I can hear,</p>

It could be summed up, more or less, as “stick to the facts.” Of course philosophy would forge the aesthetic-theoretical hardwiring of the field. If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned</p>

By claiming a structural homology among these three fields I also mean to place them on the same epistemological level, whereby none of these fields can be considered to be the cause of the other fields. Rather, all three are caused and determined by a function of different ontological and epistemological status: surplus.</p>

                     <p>Over the years, the perceived impropriety of Freud’s emphasis on the sexual dimension of the unconscious has, in the United States at least, sometimes led to a complete negation of the value of his thought. The controversy in 1995–96 over plans for a national exhibit devoted to Freud’s work and influence is a telling instance of this suppression in the public sphere both within and beyond academia. To be sure, Freud himself sometimes felt compelled to qualify a few of the more scandalous aspects of his own thinking on sexuality, such as his initial belief in his patients’ statements</p>
