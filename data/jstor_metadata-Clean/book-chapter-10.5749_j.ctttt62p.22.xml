On the practical level, there seems to be no problem, for each condemned person more or less confirms his guilt, and once all are liberated they, taking their lead from Ginés de Pasamonte, refuse to reconstitute themselves as a small new society or state of freedmen that would obey Don Quijote’s injunction to seek out the city of Toboso and there present themselves collectively before Dulcinea. Instead, in fear of the Santa Hermandad, the</p>

                     <p>This essay will be limited to the period of time between the years 1625 and 1685. During this time, moralists frequently attest to the presence of constant erotic transgressions on the baroque stage. In the distorted mirror of the merchants of morality of the seventeenth century, it seemed not only that Spanish theater of that period did not comply with the orthodoxy of decorum, but that it took pleasure in deviating from it.</p>

                     <p>There is one incessant history: the history of the body, the history of its adventures and misadventures. Throughout the life of their country, Colombian writers have narrated the history of the body, invoking different words and thus weaving this history in quite diverse ways. We propose here to narrate the history of these words, a more modest history, as are all those written in modern times.¹ This would have been impossible were it not for the extraordinary and sad atmosphere that has enveloped Colombia for many years. In fact, to attribute the debut of the body as an erotic object</p>

                     <p>During Carnaval, half-dressed women show their tanned bodies to the beat of the samba rhythm. In Ipanema, girls in their tiny bikinis parade their gracefulness down the southern beaches of Rio. The most exotic images associated with Brazilian culture are highly charged with eroticism, perpetuating the myth of sexual permissiveness. Anything is possible south of the equator.</p>
                     <p>Such images are not to be found only in the foreign imagination; they are fostered by the ideas Brazilians hold of themselves. According to a survey on Brazilians’ sexual behavior, a sort of<italic>Hite Report,</italic>some individuals claimed to sustain an enviable performance</p>

                     <p>In an initial approximation, there could hardly be two more disparate works or two more dissimilar protagonists than Don Quixote and Don Juan. The differences in age, social class, self-assigned mission, attitudes toward women, and the Apollonian versus Dionysian worldview would seem to mitigate against any similarities of consequence. It will be my purpose, nevertheless, to seek out those similarities and to suggest that difference assumes a secondary role—one that could be equated with surface structure—in comparison to the commonalities of the deeper structure made manifest in the characters’ final disposition at the hands of their authors, but</p>

                     <p>Marco Denevi is one of Argentina’s most influential and important prose writers. One of the most distinctive features of his writing is the creation of a situation in which a presumed truth has been concealed with a mask. Consequently, in Denevi’s work there always seems to be an uneasy tension, a nagging suspicion that something is definitely not what it appears to be. As the reader proceeds through the narration, the numerous false facades that hide the unexpected and sometimes shocking truth lying underneath are slowly chipped away.

While pornography may be a central fact of human artistic expression, as archaeology and historical studies have amply demonstrated (cf.<italic>The Invention of Pornography</italic>for its relationship to modern culture in general), there is yet no adequate resolution as to how to interpret its role in a global conception of cultural production.

                     <p>More than a decade after his death in 1979, Virgilio Piñera’s literature is still relatively unknown compared to that of many of his contemporaries. His contribution to Latin American theater and to Cuban narrative is undeniably important. Similarly, he exercised great influence on a younger generation of writers with whom he came in contact during his years at the helm of<italic>Ciclón</italic>(Cyclone; 1955-59), such as playwrights José Triana (1935) and Antón Arrufat (1935), and novelists such as Severo Sarduy (1937-93) and Reinaldo Arenas (1943-92) (González Echevarría 23). And yet, Piñera’s work remains elusive; perhaps more than any other Cuban</p>

                     <p>José Hernández (1824-86), with his<italic>Martín Fierro</italic>(1872 and 1879), is undoubtedly the emblematic author of Argentine identity. Critics and cultural essayists have been unable to resist constructing around him a series of supposedly national and spiritual values concerning what it means to be Argentine. At the same time, they have established the canonical character of a genre known as the gauchesque.² The theme of the gaucho has passed through various stages of transformation, even though not all works of the era are considered to be part of the gauchesque genre: from Hilario Ascasubi (1807-75) to Bartolomé Hidalgo (1788-1822) and</p>

                     <p>Some of the changes Brazilian society undertakes in the late 1960s and 1970s exemplify an authoritarian aspect of its sociopolitical values and dynamics. This aspect has much to do with the division of people into two mutually exclusive categories, the domains of masculinity and femininity, which I would like to discuss by focusing on homosexuality. While reviewing pieces of colonial literature and cultural anthropology, I propose to retrace ties between the past and the present of Brazil.</p>

                     <p>What is at stake when the ravages of the flesh nourish the ecstasy of the letter? What happens when the metaphorical condensation of love and death, so essential to the mystico-poetic tradition, is realized, actualized, literalized? How do readers and writers situate themselves with respect to texts that communicate sickness, especially when the texts engage the discourse of divinity? Despite their seemingly timeless appeal, these and other questions acquire immediacy and urgency in the crisis of representation (Simon Watney) and the brutality of idealization (Leo Bersani) that mark the age of AIDS. Brutally critical indeed: for even as AIDS has</p>
