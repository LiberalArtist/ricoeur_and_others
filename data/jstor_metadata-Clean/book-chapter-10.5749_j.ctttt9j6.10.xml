         <p>Péter Forgács is best known for his award-winning films built on home movies from the 1930s to 1960s that document ordinary lives soon to intersect with offscreen historical events. Cinema’s Alchemist offers a sustained exploration of the imagination and skill with which Forgács reshapes such footage into extraordinary films dedicated to remembering the past in ways that matter for our future.</p>

                     <p>In 1964 the respected film scholar Jay Leyda published an invaluable little book,<italic>Films Beget Films: A Study of the Compilation Film</italic>.¹ It was the first sustained effort to explore the effects of reusing footage originally intended to convey one meaning to convey a different meaning. In his foreword Leyda likens such films to H. G. Wells’s<italic>Time Machine</italic>as a way to return to and comment on the past: the “compilation machine,” as he termed this form of filmmaking, “offers itself for the communication of more abstract concepts than can be expected of the more habitual fiction film, more</p>

                     <p>In recent decades, some filmmakers have made remarkable films and videos that, in one way or another, retrieve films that are endangered, either because of their physical fragility or because of historical factors, and make them available to audiences in a new form. Instances of this approach include Alan Berliner’s<italic>A Family Album</italic>(1987), made up of excerpts from American home movies recorded in the United States during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s; Lynne Sachs’s<italic>Sermons and Sacred Pictures</italic>(1989), which recycles excerpts of films made during the 1940s and 1950s by L.

                     <p>What follows is the result of a series of exchanges conducted primarily at a distance by e-mail. I wanted to pursue a set of topics that revolved around what seemed to be nodal aspects of Péter Forgács’s overall work.These topics address the representation of historical events and the specific means by which Forgács sidesteps the conventions of both historical narratives (fiction) and traditional documentary (nonfiction). Like early documentarians in the 1920s, in that period before the practice of shaping films drawn from the practice of everyday life were commonly called documentaries, Forgács returns to the avant-garde, modernist tradition for much</p>

                     <p>Since the 1990s, the spread of memory practices in art and literature has been enormous. These memory practices manifest themselves not only around issues such as trauma, the Holocaust and other genocides, and migration but also in the increasing use of media and genres like photography, documentary film and video, the archive, and the family album. These memory practices form a specific aesthetics. The major question raised by this flourishing of memory practices is, should we see this as a celebration of memory, as a fin de siècle, and in the meantime a debut de siècle, as an expression of</p>

                     <p>In 2000, the Foundation for Jewish Culture sponsored a “First Conference of American Jewish Film Festivals” in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary of the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, the first of the American Jewish film festivals. One conference session devoted to “The Holocaust Film as Genre” was meant to grapple with the sometimes-uncomfortable fact that the Holocaust continues to be the source and subject of countless documentary films by Jewish makers. This obsessive return to the Shoah, generations after the event, is figured by some as an overinvestment in Jewish victimhood or an unwillingness to move on to other</p>

Péter Forgács’s video films focus on periods of extraordinary upheaval and cultural loss—World War II and the establishment of east-bloc Communism. They also</p>

                     <p>In phenomenology and classical film theory, “the trace” relates both to the materiality of an imprint and to the experience of an irrevocable past. It is conceived of as an indexical sign, an existential operator interrelating image, history, and memory. Traditionally it is an object, a mark inscribed, or a photograph that bears witness of life or events in the past.</p>
                     <p>In the extensive project of Péter Forgács, to evoke individual and shared histories of the Hungarian and European past, the trace materializes in the fragmentary and scratched feature of collected amateur films.

                     <p>With<italic>The Bartos Family</italic>(1988), Péter Forgács inaugurated a series of films dedicated to the history of Hungary. All these films take up the tradition of the montage or archive film,¹ also known as the foundfootage film.² More precisely, they belong to a particular current in this tradition: compilations based on home movies. This current includes different styles of production, which can be grouped roughly into four broad categories: films with a psychological tendency (intimate journals, letters, autobiographies), which utilize home movies to increase a sense of lived experience;³ montages designed to be spectacular, comic, or dramatic (such as the</p>

                     <p>In the masterful style that has become his artistic signature, Péter Forgács performs the task of a clinical archivist, evoking fragments of life stories, intercut with minimal explanatory material, through found footage and home movies in much the same way as psychoanalysis creates a narrativized intertext of continuities and discontinuities, of transference and countertransference, and of resistance and free association. The film-maker’s approach recalls that of Alain Resnais in<italic>Les statues meurent aussi</italic>(1953), in which archival images intervene in history in a cultural dialogue that critiques the French colonialist project.¹ The resulting alchemy for Forgács is not merely a</p>

Forgács’s film (which was aired on European television in 1997) provided intriguing narrative material: a network of compelling stories, a mysterious river captain whose motives remain unknown, a Central European setting full of rich historical associations, and a hypnotic musical score that created a mesmerizing tone.</p>
