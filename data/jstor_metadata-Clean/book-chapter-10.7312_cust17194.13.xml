      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Early in their careers, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida argued over madness, reason, and history in an exchange that profoundly influenced continental philosophy and critical theory. In this collection, Amy Allen, Geoffrey Bennington, Lynne Huffer, Colin Koopman, Pierre Macherey, Michael Naas, and Judith Revel, among others, trace this exchange in debates over the possibilities of genealogy and deconstruction, immanent and transcendent approaches to philosophy, and the practical and theoretical role of the archive.</p>

                     <p>There was no debate. There never was a moment when Derrida and Foucault were sitting opposite each other, on display for an audience, arguing back and forth, controlled by a mediator or provoked by a journalist. There can be no images, no transcript. Of course, the history of philosophy is full of debates whose reality and vitality does not depend on an empirical encounter of the sort Foucault had with Chomsky: writers and readers frequently proceed by staging two authors as figures to stake out opposing positions. But the strange quarrel explored in these essays is not quite of that</p>

                     <p>The starting point for the discussion between Foucault and Derrida was the 1961 publication of Foucault’s first major work,<italic>History of Madness</italic>. This began a trajectory that, over the course of the next twenty years, contributed considerably to transforming theoretical debates at the crossroads of the sciences, history, and philosophy.</p>
                     <p>Let us recall that in speaking of a history of madness Foucault marked from the outset his decision to wrest madness, or rather what he called “the experience of madness,” from the supposedly natural status assigned to it by psychiatric medicine. This medicine, with its spontaneous and naive positivism, had</p>

                     <p>Over fifty years have passed since Derrida’s “Cogito and the History of Madness” triggered a philosophical quarrel whose reverberations still haunt us.

                     <p>The latter decades of the twentieth century were witness to a resounding critique of the traditional tasks of philosophy. During these years, many of the canonical aspirations of philosophy fell into a certain kind of disrepute on a number of fronts. In America the most influential spokesperson for the assault on the standard assumptions of modern philosophy was Richard Rorty. In Germany the scandal was associated with Jürgen Habermas and the Frankfurt School. But perhaps the North Atlantic milieu in which philosophy came under the severest critical attack was France, where a range of thinkers came to be presented as</p>

                     <p>One way foucault and derrida’s debate about the<italic>History of Madness</italic>has been framed is as articulating the methodological contrast of their respective endeavors. On this reading, at stake in the debate is the way in which archaeology or discourse analysis, in Foucault’s sense, and Derridean deconstruction relate to each other. This is a rich question, and in what follows, I focus on just one of its dimensions—the transformation of the transcendental question that is at stake primarily on Derrida’s side of the debate.</p>

                     <p>The critical reception of foucault’s work, particularly his early work, is marked by a curious convergence. Two of Foucault’s staunchest critics are philosophers who otherwise have very little in common, indeed, who had their own, quite heated and very public, debate: Jacques Derrida and Jürgen Habermas.¹ Moreover, the content of Derrida’s and Habermas’s criticisms of the early Foucault is strikingly similar; both philosophers deploy a kind of performative contradiction argument against Foucault’s critique of reason (though only Habermas uses that specific terminology). As Colin Koopman puts the point: “Thinkers who usually see themselves as opposed to one another—for example,</p>

                     <p>A body of thought is too often reduced to a “silhouette” that one thinks is a summary. In thus personifying the work of philosophy, we take away its thickness. But this complexity does not exist in isolation, any more than it can be frozen in time in the form of an unchanging position. Bodies of thought enrich and transform each other through the play of interactions and reactions, strategies and exchanges, and conflicts and ruptures. One body of thought thus implicates others. This relation is not constructed simply by borrowing from, or subscribing to, other thoughts, any more than the</p>

                     <p>In the 1990s, nearly thirty years after the publication of “Cogito and the History of Madness,” Derrida returned to Foucault in a text intended to mark the thirtieth anniversary of Foucault’s<italic>Histoire de la folie</italic>. In “‘To Do Justice to Freud’” (“‘Être juste avec Freud’”), Derrida revisits some of the central questions in the contretemps around<italic>History of Madness</italic>and “Cogito and the History of Madness,” but he does so in the context of an engagement with Foucault that extends the debate in a new direction.

Consistent with those openings, the telephone becomes, at one point in his<italic>The Death Penalty, Volume 1</italic>, an umbilical cord. Here is Derrida describing teletechnology</p>
