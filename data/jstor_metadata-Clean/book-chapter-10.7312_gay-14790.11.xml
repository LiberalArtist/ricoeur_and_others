      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Money and support tend to flow in the direction of economics, science, and other academic departments that demonstrate measurable "progress." The humanities, on the other hand, offer more abstract and uncertain outcomes. A humanist's objects of study are more obscure in certain ways than pathogens and cells. Consequently, it seems as if the humanities never truly progress. Is this a fair assessment?</p>
         <p>By comparing objects of science, such as the brain, the galaxy, the amoeba, and the quark, with objects of humanistic inquiry, such as the poem, the photograph, the belief, and the philosophical concept, Volney Gay reestablishes a fundamental distinction between science and the humanities. He frees the latter from its pursuit of material-based progress and restores its disciplines to a place of privilege and respect. Using the metaphor of magnification, Gay shows that, while we can investigate natural objects to the limits of imaging capacity, magnifying cultural objects dissolves them into noise. In other words, cultural objects can be studied only within their contexts and through the prism of metaphor and narrative.</p>
         <p>Gathering examples from literature, art, film, philosophy, religion, science, and psychoanalysis, Gay builds a new justification for the humanities. By revealing the unseen and making abstract ideas tangible, the arts create meaningful wholes, which itself is a form of progress.</p>

                     <p>The campus is quiet in the morning. A university police car glides across an empty parking lot, the end of the night shift. Steam rises from my carryout coffee as I wait for the walk signal on 21st Avenue. I peer across the street at three buildings in front of me. On the right, against the gray sky, I see the spire of Vanderbilt Divinity School. It is a brick three-story building constructed in 1960. It houses some 30 professors and serves 180 divinity students and about 100 graduate students. Directly in front of me is Vanderbilt’s central library—abrick</p>

                     <p>The question of progress in the humanities is an ancient one. To offer a new answer, I suggest we compare the objects of humanistic inquiry to the objects of natural science. They are radically different. To show this, I use an unusual device: the magnifying lens. Using the magnifying lens, we can distinguish two types of object: one type (objects amenable to natural science) can sustain magnification; the other type (objects typical of humanistic inquiry) cannot. I demonstrate this thesis in two slide shows; the short version summarized above, and a longer version entitled “Magnification” on my web page.¹ These</p>

                     <p>In the previous chapter, I argued against the notion of “depth” in depth psychology and similar forms of humanistic inquiry. It serves little purpose when we use it to think about progress in the humanities. I have not concluded, therefore, that there can be no progress in humanistic enterprises. On the contrary, we can point to numerous moments of humanistic success. They are not cumulative in the way that science is. This demarcates something important about humanistic enterprises, namely that they begin anew with each new generation.</p>

Medical science progresses when it helps increase the quality of life and eliminates a disease like polio.

The need to earn a living to support his family, and perhaps Viennese anti-Semitism, drove him out of the research university and into private medical practice. There, treating neurotic patients, he developed the discipline that was to become psychoanalysis.
