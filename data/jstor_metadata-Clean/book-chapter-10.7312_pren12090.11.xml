      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Moving deftly among literary and visual arts, as well as the modern critical canon, Christopher Prendergast's book explores the meaning and value of representation as both a philosophical challenge (What does it mean to create an image that "stands for" something absent?) and a political issue (Who has the right to represent whom?).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>The Triangle of Representation</italic>raises a range of theoretical, historical, and aesthetic questions, and offers subtle readings of such cultural critics as Raymond Williams, Paul de Man, Edward Said, Walter Benjamin, and Hélène Cixous, in addition to penetrating investigations of visual artists like Gros, Ingres, and Matisse and significant insights into Proust and the onus of translating him. Above all, Prendergast's work is a striking display of how a firm grounding in theory is essential for the exploration of art and literature.</p>

But alongside the directness and confidence of address, we should also remember the many hesitancies and uncertainties, along with the constant reaching for complexity. The endlessly backtracking and self-qualifying style (what Robin Blackburn has called Williams’s “characteristic mode of piling qualification upon complexity”) tells of a strategy not merely of ordinary intellectual scrupulousness but also of active unsettlement of terms and positions (from a man many of whose existential and political preferences were for settled forms of life against the huge</p>
