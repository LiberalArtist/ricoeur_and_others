      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xing√∫ society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.</p>

                     <p>One of the more remarkable stories of Native South American ethnic survival is that of the people who live in a region of the country Brazilians call the Alto Xingu (Upper Xingu), centered around the headwaters of the Rio Xingu, a major northward-flowing tributary of the Amazon. Although most likely visited by eighteenth-century<italic>bandeirantes</italic>(adventurers in search of slaves and precious minerals), the scientific exploration of this region was first undertaken in the last two decades of the nineteenth century by the German explorer-scholars Karl von den Steinen and Hermann Meyer (Meyer 1897, 1898, 1900; Steinen 1886, 1894). In 1884,</p>

As a novice, my first research goal was to try to learn how to speak to the residents in their own language, and for this purpose I began my work by asking for lists of words for things, using as a translator the single Portuguese-speaking man present in the settlement at that time and the only person who used a Portuguese name.

                     <p>The first warrior story I ever heard was told during my visit to the Kalapalo in 1967. I was staying in a big house belonging to one of the largest households in Aifa, led by Ugaki, her husband, Maidyuta, and her brother Agakuni and his wife, Kafundzu. Ugaki and Agakuni were the sister and brother of Ahpƒ©≈©, one of two important leaders of Aifa community at the time. He lived in a house directly across the central plaza from theirs. Nearly every day in the dry season, the old leader would visit his relatives in the late afternoon to drink</p>

Madyuta had recently heard this story from his sister‚Äôs husband, a Kuikuro man descended from the Tafununu Lake Community mentioned in the narrative. For several years this man had gone during the dry season with his younger relatives to farm beside Tafununu. When he visited the Kalapalo just prior to such a trip, as a gift to his hosts Madyuta‚Äôs brother-in-law told the story of Tapoge.</p>

It is a story whose events took place many years after Tapoge died, and in it, we learn how that warrior died and how his death influenced what happened to his former son-in-law. Taken together, the two stories seem rather like a grim family history.</p>

Despite a strong conviction of shared values and practices, as well as certain mutual interests, people of the Alto Xingu see these as having been adopted piecemeal, and in some cases (most critically, peaceful behavior and maintaining a diet free of animal flesh) incompletely. Moreover, the idea of ‚Äúsociety,‚Äù conceived in the abstract and independently of the actual ongoing relationships between people, is foreign to them.

                     <p>One of the smaller and most fragile communities of the Upper Xingu region is the Trumai. The earliest Trumai communities that we know of (reported by the German explorer Karl von den Steinen during his mid-nineteenth-century trip to the region) were two: one located far to the south in the region of the early Carib settlements, the other found in the northern region to the east of the Rio Culuene. The Trumai suffered considerably during their residence in the north, being attacked by the Suya and continuously intimidated by their neighbors the Kamaiura. Disease substantially reduced their numbers, as did</p>

                     <p>Once the Alto Xingu communities recognized that they had come to share common values, they began to develop ways of dealing with outsiders that were peaceful rather than aggressive. This was sometimes even the case in situations where outsiders posed threats to them. In certain stories about events that took place long after the end of cannibalistic blood feuding, the warrior remains an important though more peaceful figure. But a more ominous practice is developing: the killing of known people, usually people living within a community, because of witchcraft accusations. The fear and anger directed formerly against enemies living elsewhere</p>

                     <p>One afternoon in late January 1979, during the height of the rainy season when food was particularly scarce, Tsangaku, one of Kambe‚Äôs two elderly surviving wives, began to tell me stories of her father‚Äôs settlement, Kanugidyaf√Øt√Ø. Men had repeatedly gone out to fish and had returned with nothing, commenting upon how close the floodwaters had come to the settlement. The young men in Tsangaku‚Äôs household went out mainly for the form of demonstrating their affinal duties but without any hope of actually finding something to eat. We were all living off manioc soup and bread, yellow squash, corn, and the</p>

                     <p>During my attempts to understand the narratives in this book and what the Kalapalo storytellers were trying to say to me, I found valuable two concepts which tend to be applied to modern and modernizing societies rather than the nonliterate, relatively detached communities in the Alto Xingu. These are ‚Äúideology‚Äù and ‚Äúbiography.‚Äù Having used the terms in a somewhat implicit manner in the early sections of the book, I turn now to more explicit discussion of the relationships between them to explore some of the consequences of recognizing these relationships in oral genres, so as to better understand narrative representations</p>
