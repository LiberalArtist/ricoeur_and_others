      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Twenty years on from the dramatic events that led to the opening of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the GDR, the subjective dimension of German unification is still far from complete. The nature of the East German state remains a matter of cultural as well as political debate. This volume of new research focuses on competing memories of the GDR and the ways they have evolved in the mass media, literature, and film since 1989-90. Taking as its point of departure the impact of iconic visual images of the fall of the Wall on our understanding of the historical GDR, the volume first considers the decade of cultural conflict that followed unification and then the emergence of a more complex and diverse "textual memory" of the GDR since the Berlin Republic was established in 1999. It highlights competing generational perspectives on the GDR era and the unexpected "afterlife" of the GDR in recent publications. The volume as a whole shows the vitality of eastern German culture two decades after the demise of the GDR and the centrality of these memory debates to the success of Germany's unification process.

                     <p>The fundamental changes in world politics in the early 1990s — the breakup of the Soviet bloc and the subsequent reconfiguration of eastern Europe as new constellations of power emerged — dominated television programming internationally for many months. Live news coverage shaped the way people perceived these events. Television as a medium was an important part of these processes and has determined how they are remembered today. West German television played a particularly crucial role during the weeks of political turmoil in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the fall of 1989. There was complex interaction between the political protagonists,</p>

Not only does the expression “Stein-Kopf” refer to the eponymous peak in the Taunus mountain range, which Jirgl became acquainted with during his time as writer-in-residence in Bergen-Enkheim, it also captures the ethos of obstinacy that characterizes his poetics. It can of course be argued — as the satirist Gerhard Henschel has — that such self-positioning is pompous or elitist.² Those familiar with Jirgl’s</p>

                     <p>The front cover of the first edition of Irina Liebmann’s documentary volume <italic>Stille Mitte von Berlin</italic> bears a photograph of the Postfuhramt, the historic post-office building in Berlin’s Oranienburger Straße where the horses drawing the city’s mail coaches were once stabled.¹ Taken in the early 1980s as an aide-memoire for Liebmann’s project on the history of this part of the city, the picture is of poor quality, with fading colors and a slight blurring of the focus (fig. 13.1). This creates an air of neglect, which is heightened by the austerity of the subject matter: the street is virtually empty,</p>

                     <p>Taking my cue from a few telling remarks in Franz Fühmann’s 1973 Hungarian travel diary <italic>Zweiundzwanzig Tage</italic>, I want to examine the figure of the “iota of difference” in reference to really existing socialism.¹ I come to a discussion of Fühmann’s curious passage in the second half of this essay. To begin with, however, I explain why I find the iota so apt for characterizing the memory of GDR socialism now that so little socialism of any kind remains. In other than a mocking sense the iota might turn out to be indicative to me alone, so I cannot pretend</p>
