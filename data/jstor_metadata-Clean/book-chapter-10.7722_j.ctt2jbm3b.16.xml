         <p>Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century. Dr Nicole Grimes is a Marie Curie Fellow at University College Dublin (UCD), and the University of California, Irvine. Dr Siobhán Donovan is a College Lecturer at the School of Languages and Literatures, UCD. Dr Wolfgang Marx is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Music, UCD.</p>

                     <p>Any serious account of musical criticism or aesthetics in the nineteenth century has to confront Eduard Hanslick at some point. For more than forty years, he was the leading music critic in Vienna, one of Europe’s cultural capitals, and his brief treatise on aesthetics, <italic>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</italic>, remains the central document in the history of the concept known as “absolute music,” the idea of music as a wholly self-referential art of pure form.</p>
                     <p>But music was about more than music in Hanslick’s Vienna, as he himself well knew. It was a cultural battlefield that pitted defenders of the city’s musical past—</p>

                     <p>Eduard Hanslick is celebrated today primarily for his seminal publication in the field of music aesthetics—<italic>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen: Ein Beitrag zur Revision der Ästhetik der Tonkunst</italic>. Upon its initial publication in Leipzig in 1854, this small book elicited controversy and heated debate. The nine subsequent editions published throughout Hanslick’s lifetime—between 1858 and 1902¹—ensured that the text remained the focus of debate on musical aesthetics well into the twentieth century.</p>

                     <p>Hanslick’s name barely appears in current popular or everyday culture—and yet, most musicians do recognize “Hanslick,” albeit with an unmistakable bias in their reception.

                     <p>Readers usually interpret Eduard Hanslick’s famous treatise <italic>On the Musically Beautiful</italic> in light of its memorable statements and arguments that articulate a “formalist” position, that is, an account of self-sufficient musical art, purely musical beauty, and an appropriate contemplative mode of listening. In this standard interpretation, Hanslick’s treatise remains, to the present, the most prominent example of formalism in musical aesthetics.</p>

The result is that Hanslick’s theories on musical aesthetics are often abbreviated to handy catch-phrases, a practice that attests to the ideological prejudice of many of his contemporaries, and that has subsequently prevented an objective and substantive dialogue with his aesthetic theory. Despite avoiding such a polemical tone, <italic>Das Musikalisch-Schöne und das Gesammtkunstwerk vom Standpunkte der formalen Ästhetik</italic>,¹ published by Otakar Hostinský (1847–1910) in 1877, was poorly received and is largely forgotten today.

                     <p>As an observer of late nineteenth-century Viennese cultural life, Eduard Hanslick towers above all other journalists and writers who attempted to map the changing face of music in this period.¹ He has been typecast as the archenemy of musical progress, a foe to any who questioned the sacred tenets of “absolute” music, of which he was alleged to be a seminal theorist and tireless propagandist.² His championing of Brahms, as guardian of what he considered the legitimate compositional tradition, is as celebrated as his opposition to Liszt, Wagner, and their ilk, is notorious.

                     <p>The historian Peter Gay concludes his 1978 book <italic>Freud, Jews and Other Germans: Masters and Victims in Modernist Culture</italic> with a chapter entitled “For Beckmesser: Eduard Hanslick, Victim and Prophet.” What is remarkable about the chapter is Gay’s studied avoidance of the issue of anti-Semitism as it relates to arguments about <italic>Die Meistersinger</italic> or Hanslick, or both. In a book that elsewhere addresses issues of anti-Semitism, this last chapter fashions Hanslick as one of the “other Germans” of its title. The issue of anti-Semitism, however, is picked up in two of the chapter’s footnotes. Footnote fourteen cites Friedrich Blume’s encyclopedia</p>
