         <p>The authors—recognized historians, ethnologists, folklorists coming from four continents—present the latest research findings on the relationship, coexistence and conflicts of popular belief systems, Judeo-Christian mythology and demonology in medieval and modern Europe. The present volume focuses on the divergence between Western and Eastern evolution, on the different relationship of learned demonology to popular belief systems in the two parts of Europe. It discusses the conflict of saints, healers, seers, shamans with the representatives of evil; the special function of escorting, protecting, possessing, harming and healing spirits; the role of the dead, the ghosts, of pre-Christian, Jewish and Christian spirit-world, the antagonism of the devil and the saint.</p>

                     <p>The curious genre of medieval magical handbooks has been researched for many decades. Already Lynn Thorndike, in his famous <italic>History of Magic and Experimental Science,</italic> gave a typology and an exhaustive description of magical practices, including the relatively innocent methods connected with the secrets of the natural world, and the explicitly demonic or angelic procedures. Although Thorndike gave a thorough characterization of the sources, read and listed the most important Western manuscripts, it is still possible to go deeper into the topic, the field is left open for further investigations.</p>

                     <p>Barbara Newman, in her study of devout women, demoniacs, and the apostolic life in thirteenth-century Europe proposed that in her material (thirteenth-century <italic>exempla</italic>) the demoniacs “played a necessary part on the stage of the evangelical drama—so necessary, indeed, that if they had not existed, clerics would have had to invent them” (Newman 1998).

The appearances of specific forms of the devil are closely related to the evolution and changes of the notion of the devil.

The Protestant denomination became dominant with a share estimated by some at 60–70%. The decorative objects with inscriptions were used by the upper strata of society, but their appearance in urban public offices in the churches (furniture, chests,</p>

                     <p>In Swedish folklore in Finland the devil was regarded as a helper when a woman was in pain giving birth to her child. Alternatively, he helped a mother to make her unwanted baby disappear. In this paper I shall consider the folklore texts as complements to the creation myth in Genesis. My inspiration comes from theories on intertextuality. I combine these thoughts with studies of tricksters and culture heroes. Although the Finland-Swedish folklore records do not refer to the Bible <italic>expressis verbis</italic>, I find it possible to understand them as inverted extensions of the Judeo-Christian creation myth.</p>
