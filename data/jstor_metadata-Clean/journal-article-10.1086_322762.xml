      <body>
         <p>This volume has two interpretive aims. One is to read Mill in a way that recognizes a distinction between liberty—the ability to act without interference—and freedom—principally understood as the ability to act autonomously. The other is to show how Mill saw freedom as both threatened by and supported by various forms of social power. Mill is criticized as an “essentialist” (p. 39) for insisting that truly free persons must be taught a wide variety of practices and traditions from which to choose. Nonetheless, the author argues that Mill has a richer understanding of the value of “positive freedom” than do Berlin, Nozick, and Rawls.</p>
         <p>Long on exposition and shorter on analysis, this book persuasively assuages doubts (if anyone had them) that Mill was interested in more than just state interference with one’s choices. But it is harder to see why we should believe, as Baum claims, that a life formed from a compulsory and narrow education into a specific way of living is just as free (in<italic>any</italic>of Mill’s senses) as one formed in response to a liberal and nonpunitive education. Baum promises (but fails) to show that Mill’s account of social power (“the capacity to affect change,” p. 72) and freedom provides a “liberal response” to communitarians. The egalitarian distribution of social power to which Mill is said to be committed is in conflict with many valued forms of life. Berlin’s injunction that we avoid both conflating freedom with other values and insisting on their ultimate reconciliation is particularly apt in this context.</p>

         <p>This latest book by France’s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. The book, first, engages in a sustained critique of the illusions that philosophy falls into when it ignores the historical, social, and economic conditions of its objects and its own existence. He is particularly concerned with the errors that arise from collapsing practical, embodied, everyday ways of knowing into theoretical models of knowledge, though he also criticizes forms of false universalism in morality and aesthetics, which ignore the empirical realities of differential distributions of economic and cultural capital and of access to the requisite dispositions and interests required for political and cultural participation. Second, the book provides a critique of current social‐scientific methodologies, while promoting Bourdieu’s preferred “reflexive realism,” intended to avoid both objectivism and relativism through a radical historicization of social‐scientific reason itself. Unfortunately, this section lacks the sustained, careful argumentation that philosophers of social science might wish for. Third, the last three—and strongest—chapters present Bourdieu’s leading concepts and basic social analyses: “habitus” as an agent’s embodied, affectively conditioned practical knowledge and dispositions; social space as differentiated into fields of symbolic struggle over cultural capital; the reproduction of social order through dialectical attunement between objective structures and habitus; and the symbolic violence arising from differential access to the means and sites for defining the categories and stakes of symbolic fields. The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu’s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.</p>

         <p>How might a commitment to political liberalism be maintained when people generally have a greater commitment to their more particular cultural and religious values? This collection of essays would have liberalism compromise from the outset: “A liberal political order needs to somehow find peace with social institutions and practices based on belief and moral tradition ” (p. xii). The contributors propose expanding the role of religion in public life (Jean Bethke Elshtain), inculcating a stronger sense of patriotic citizenship (Walter Berns), and promoting individual virtue (Douglas J. Den Uyl). Many of the essays argue that since religion is the genesis of fundamental liberal ideals, such as equal respect for persons, political liberalism ultimately must rely for its justification on core religious values. This kind of argument is fallacious: we may reasonably hold certain values even if we come to reject a formerly accepted basis for those values. Loss of faith in religious dictates still leaves a prohibition against killing, for instance, with the support of good public reasons. But these essays do serve as a guide to the apprehensions of philosophical and political commentators frustrated by what they see as contemporary liberalism in theory and practice.</p>

         <p>This collection of essays comes out of a joint project between the Hastings Center and Stanford University’s Center for Biomedical Ethics. Essay topics include several discussions of the tensions between individual liberty and pursuit of the common good; the ethics of various incentives to shape health behavior; the costs savings (or lack of same) achievable by health promotion; the choice between strategies that focus on changing individual behavior and those that change the social determinants of health (particularly income disparities); and the impending misuses of genetic testing as a tool of disease prevention.</p>
         <p>Some essays provide useful information. The discussion by Schauffler is especially good at disabusing the reader of any idea that health promotion and disease prevention will save money. The ethical sophistication of the essays varies widely. Some are little more than exhortations on behalf of a communitarian public health. There are repeated discussions of the tension between communitarian and libertarian approaches to public health, usually at a level of generality unhelpful for evaluating specific health promotion strategies. A notable exception is the essay by Robertson, who uses the data connecting income disparities and health to argue that improved health is a common good which benefits all.</p>

         <p>This is a fine volume, with essays of consistently high quality, and unique in its focus on the “recent” Rawls of<italic>Political Liberalism</italic>. Many of the authors will be familiar to readers of<italic>Ethics</italic>—for example, Marilyn Friedman, James Sterba, Allen Buchanan, Claudia Card, and Richard Arneson. All but two of the fourteen essays are new.</p>
         <p>On one common telling (rehearsed, in various ways, in the essays by Claudia Mills, Norman Daniels, Clark Wolf, and in the editors’ introduction), “political liberalism” falls uneasily between two extremes: one extreme is the hope of founding political community on a shared, comprehensive conception of the good; the other extreme is settling for a “mere” modus vivendi, where moral consensus gives way to the balancing of social and political forces. The sense of “philosophical loss” (Daniels’s phrase) that comes from abandoning the first extreme is powerfully represented in Friedman’s “melancholy conclusion” that Rawls has not shown that political liberalism is anything more than “one … political doctrine among many” (p. 31). Perhaps more surprising, however, is the number of contributors who are willing to put in “a good word for a modus vivendi” (the title of Bernard Dauenhauer’s essay), championing its ability to achieve stability (Mills), allow for experimentation (Dauenhauer), and be more inclusive (Scott Hershovitz). Wolf and Daniels, in what are arguably the volume’s two best essays, both defend Rawlsian justice “after politicization.”</p>
         <p>I have emphasized only one strand in this collection, though its reach is much broader, including excellent essays on Rawls and international justice (Buchanan), Rawls and utilitarianism (Arneson), and Rawls on the moral status of children (Samantha Brennan and Robert Noggle).</p>

         <p>This collection of essays, which originated in a 1996 symposium at the Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, seeks to foster a renewal of interest in political phenomenology. Eleven essays are divided into four chapters: “Basic Concepts,” “Figures,” “Fundamental Issues,” and “Race.” Not all of the essays are equally successful, and there is a great deal of variation in the degree to which each essay adheres to a phenomenological method. Yet the best of these essays make valuable contributions to political theory as such. There are clear and insightful analyses of the political thought of Husserl, Ricoeur, and Schutz. There are strong phenomenological accounts of the nature of the political actor, by Steven Crowell, and of the relationship between intersubjective experience and the community, by Adriaan Peperzak. R. Philip Buckley brings Husserl’s thoughts on politics to bear on the situation in Quebec and Robert Bernasconi contributes a fine meditation on racism. Overall, this book has value for anyone interested in political theory. It would be essential reading for anyone interested in phenomenology’s encounter with the political sphere.</p>

         <p>Two contrary, basic positions can be taken on the normative relation between distributive justice and criminal justice: either (1) concerns of distributive justice such as poverty, race, or gender cannot affect matters of criminal justice or (2) distributive justice can affect one or more aspects of criminal justice. The independence thesis of (1) and the dependence thesis of (2) are complicated when a particular aspect of criminal justice is specified, such as criminal liability, sentencing, enforcement, procedure, or legal representation. The trick is to articulate a conceptually coherent and supported version of either thesis, taking account of constraints of institutional design and legitimacy.</p>
         <p>The book’s eleven essays focus on poverty or economic disadvantage: one piece deals with available data on economic variables relating to crime and legal representation, the other ten directly or in passing endorse or reject the independence thesis. The quality of the essays is mixed. On the positive side, Jeremy Waldron quickly adapts an argument from the overinclusiveness of legal rules to reject indigence as a legal justification for property crime. Stephen Morse usefully rehearses and dismisses prevalent invalid inferences from economic disadvantage to criminal nonculpability. Loren Lomasky’s welfarist libertarian case for subsidizing legal representation of criminal defendants is nicely outlined. William Heffernan’s reliance on restrictions on justifications available to decision makers is a potentially fruitful move. At points some of the essays progress by bare assignments of burdens of proof rather than hard argument. Must dependence theorists have in hand a complete theory of distributive justice? Who must show that notions of authority bar judges from invoking controversial normative theories, at least when consistent with authoritative legal sources? Who must show that criteria of legal responsibility should include morally relevant psychological variables, such as stress, in addition to minimal normative and cognitive capacities? Sometimes the argument is too brief. Because legal rules need not advertise their background justifications, defendants often plausibly can claim that deviation from a rule of property law vindicates the rule’s justification. Thus, against Waldron, it is unlikely that the mere “logic” of property rights prevents indigence from being a legal justification for property crimes. More needs to be said. Brevity particularly mars Pettit’s “republican” defense of the dependence thesis in criminal sentencing. Because the defense requires that criminal sanctions aim at assuring nondomination of victims, indigence can ground different sanctions for the same offense, as Pettit concedes. But then republicanism also can support nonculpability for an indigent’s acts, where they present no realistic threat of domination. Equality of offenders at the level of criminal liability—not just their equal treatment—seems violated here. Further, the efficacy of criminal sanctions can demand domination over the offender. For both reasons, something therefore needs to be said about the connection between republican bases of liability and sentencing.</p>

         <p>“Moral combat” is Hurd’s name for interpersonal moral dilemmas, in particular, the case of a judge obligated to punish a citizen who has justifiably disobeyed the law (a case of blamed right doing). The book is ambitious, covering moral relativism, political authority, the rule of law, consequentialism and deontology on role‐relative morality, and more. Weaving these strands together is “the dilemma of legal perspectivalism” (p. 1). The rule of law seems to imply that the judge is required to punish the disobedient citizen, but a deeply held retributivist principle forbids punishing justified action.</p>
         <p>Hurd favors the retributivist principle over the rule of law. Using an argument sure to provoke debate, Hurd concludes that consequentialism’s theory of the right cannot countenance blamed right doing. In contrast, deontology lacks an analogous entailment. Yet Hurd doesn’t explore why the substance of deontology favors retributivism over the rule of law. Her answer might be that this isn’t needed, since moral combat is unacceptably paradoxical. But the deontologist who favors the rule of law doesn’t see it that way, and simply asserting it doesn’t help. Though the arguments may not be conclusive, her book is admirably systematic, rigorous, clear, informed, and reasonable.</p>

         <p>Lacey examines the question of whether science is value free in a manner making his book a good classroom tool to use alongside past positivistic philosophy of science or more contemporary work. He couches the question in terms of theory acceptance: are they evaluated impartially, executed neutrally, within an autonomous discipline—complete with a distinction between contexts of discovery and justification (pp. 232–33)? Broadening the book’s scope are chapters considering challenges from feminist and grassroots empowerment approaches, and Lacey’s careful arguments are worth discussion particularly since, surprisingly, he concludes that science is not value free after all.</p>
         <p>The book reads as an enthusiastic defense of science being a value‐free enterprise, a thesis depending upon a difference in kind between epistemic values and other ethical values. Lacey’s approach is quite abstract and it is not clear what disciplines are included under the rubric of “science” and it is questionable whether all sciences are amenable to his analysis. Lacey concentrates on one aspect of scientific practice, theory acceptance, but scientific activity arguably is more than that and even a successful argument here calls up the image of plugging a leaking dike with one’s finger. Lacey’s richest chapter is the penultimate where he revises his position on scientific objectivity, neutrality, and autonomy but his interesting conclusion on the envalued nature of science is confined to a brief discussion in his short concluding chapter. He will perhaps furnish a more rewarding exploration of that subject in the future.</p>

         <p>This anthology of ten essays framed by an introduction and annotated bibliography (1500–1700) might be read as a protest book: scholars from a wide range of disciplines but all with historical focus insist that tolerance had more than liberal origins, in effect refuting “that John Locke invented toleration and that John Stuart Mill perfected it” (p. x). The subtitle, invoking a fifteenth‐century plea for tolerance, may mislead if “rites” implies liturgy. Rather, these essays offer voices of toleration in unexpected places: Cyrus of Persia, a medieval Chinese culture so hospitable to Jews that they were absorbed and disappeared, theologians pleading for tolerance toward American Indians in sixteenth‐century Spain, for acceptance of Muslims in Renaissance England, and for forbearance if not for religious liberty in pre‐Enlightenment Europe. For ethics the two most helpful entries are the editor’s clarification of the concepts and shadings of tolerance, both contemporary and historical, and a splendid essay by Sammy Basu on humor and toleration, “Woe unto you that laugh now!” Scholarly in tone, extensive in endnotes, authors assume that one can only understand the nature of texts advocating tolerance in their historical contexts. While these essays mostly look to religious protests against oppression and intolerance, the reader may well conclude that the Enlightenment was not misnamed.</p>

         <p>Ziba Mir‐Hosseini’s study focuses, as the title indicates, on gender or, more particularly, on the status of women in Islam. To say only that is to say far too little, however. Mir‐Hosseini’s remarkable contribution rests on her willingness to focus on modes of argument current among scholars of Islamic religious law in Iran. In this, she presents herself neither as a reformist interpreter of Islam nor as a Muslim apologist. Rather, Mir‐Hosseini is a kind of interested rapporteur, whose willingness to take seriously the reflections of recognized religious specialists enables her to present readers with the variety of authoritative opinion regarding women’s roles in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Extensive interviews are joined with close readings of scholarly texts to illustrate the approaches Mir‐Hosseini classifies as traditionalist, neotraditionalist, and modernist. Everyone interested in Islam, contemporary debates about gender roles, or styles of argument in ethics will benefit from reading Mir‐Hosseini’s book. Indeed, portions of the volume might be used in courses that introduce students to ethics through an examination of arguments about moral problems or gender roles.</p>

         <p>This first‐rate collection of seventeen original essays, many by prominent feminist philosophers, provides an overview of issues and methodologies at the heart of global feminism and multicultural and postcolonial thought. Sets of essays debate whether global, postcolonial, feminist thinking entails a cultural relativism that precludes talk about universal human rights; provide excellent examples of the method of intersectional analysis; explore the defects of older models of women in development and third world economic development; pay special attention to Latina feminism and illustrations of global, postcolonial theorizing that invoke the North‐South border; offer constructive advice about how antiracist whites might best transform white identity; and explain how problematic empiricist assumptions can be avoided by feminist work relying on narratives of experience and by science. Some articles offer useful overviews, for example, Sandra Harding’s essay on economic development and Ann Cudd’s essay on feminist epistemology. Others, especially the debate over cultural relativism, take original positions. Uma Narayan’s essay is worth the price of the book; she shows how efforts to respect cultural differences often repeat colonial assumptions about “essential differences” and ignore the political history behind a culture’s choice of which practices to treat as defining its Tradition.</p>

         <p>This book is the first to provide a case study approach to the ethical issues of human interactions with animals. The introduction provides a clear and concise overview of the major ethical issues and the ways in which utilitarian and rights‐based ethical theories address them, followed by an account of the casuist approach. The sixteen case studies which follow cover biomedical research, cosmetic testing, behavioral studies, wildlife research, educational uses of animals, uses of animals for food, treatment of companion animals, and ritual animal sacrifice. Animal experimentation is most extensively treated, while the moral issues pertaining to animal agriculture and the possible ethical responses to it are treated less comprehensively. (For example, the possibility that vegetarianism is an appropriate moral response to the harms caused to animals in factory farming is only briefly discussed.) In general, however, this book presents the cases clearly and raises the ethical questions in all of their complexity. This book would be an especially useful text for students in biomedical ethics courses and would also be useful in courses in applied ethics, veterinary medicine, law, and public policy.</p>
         <p>One of the most difficult and important questions regarding the uses of animals in research is the question of whether there ought to be restrictions on the uses of animals in exemplary basic research. Where the research is clearly pursuing important scientific questions but is invasive, the costs to animals are high and the potential benefits to knowledge are also high, but often unknown. Orlans et al. do indeed raise this question (p. 80) but unfortunately choose to raise it in the context of a case which is, at best, notorious and questionable: the Gennarelli head injury experiments. In these experiments researchers can be seen violating state and federal laws, performing procedures which violate their own research protocols, and ridiculing the animals. While the general interest of this case warrants discussion on many other grounds, surely, there are better examples of scientific research which might have been used in discussing the important issue of basic research.</p>

         <p>Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.</p>
         <p>While Patten’s treatment of these issues is quite cogent, his work on Hegel falters at points. His argument relies at one stage on making sense of Hegelian “concrete universality,” but Patten seems impatient with the task of explaining it and neglects to grapple with Hegel’s logic. And because Patten places inadequate emphasis on the role of mutual recognition in Hegel’s social philosophy, he develops a reading of Hegel that, while appealing, is excessively individualistic, both in general and specifically in the case of Hegel.</p>

         <p>Feyerabend’s epistemology is “harmless and benign” (p. 148), it merely expresses neurobiological facts about ordinary cognition (Paul Churchland). Far from harmless, his epistemological relativism undermines liberal democracy and personal autonomy (J. N. Hattiangadi). Not so, since Feyerabend followed Mill and adopted a relativist stance only to heighten the appreciation of truth (Elisabeth Lloyd). He went further than Mill, however, when questioning the place of truth in human flourishing (Sheldon Reaven). And rather than reveal truth, Feyerabend’s<italic>reductio</italic>arguments demonstrate the possibility of overthrowing the empirical basis of received views (Gonzalo Munévar). This shows that Feyerabend did not adequately appreciate Newton’s rule, according to which alternative hypotheses should only be proposed when new evidence warrants it (Peter Achinstein). But Feyerabend provided a profoundly nuanced critique of Newton’s unfollowable rule that one should listen to experience only (Bas van Fraassen). He was confused and confusing, however, when in his opposition to Popper he claimed that science violates the laws of logic (John Watkins). And he retracted much of his criticism of Kuhn when he finally understood him (Paul Hoyningen‐Huene). Rather than settle old debates, one might engage Feyerabend’s “New Metaphysic” of the 1990s and advance his effort to move beyond the deceptive realism/relativism dichotomy (John Preston).</p>
         <p>According to John Watkins, Feyerabend “often writes so that he<italic>cannot</italic>be read properly” (p. 54), but this volume suggests that Feyerabend’s views become more challenging with the quality of the questions put to him. Unfortunately, Joachim Jung’s “Last Interview” at Feyerabend’s deathbed falls short in this regard.</p>

         <p>Sheleff’s book engages a question central to modern liberal societies: given the lack of common social norms (and commitment to maintaining that lack), how can we use legal coercion to establish social order consistent with the practice of liberal principles?</p>
         <p>Sheleff identifies four areas where his targets fail. Each endorsed a progressive view of social evolution, concluding that coercion would dissipate with social development. Each ignored available evidence contradicting their theories. Each confused the degree to which law shapes culture rather than reflecting its values or structure. Each minimized their ideological interpretation of evidence. Sheleff’s critiques are convincing and thoroughly supported, though sometimes obvious. His discussions are admirably comprehensive; unfortunately, his lengthy analysis of secondary texts often obscures his more provocative ideas.</p>
         <p>Sheleff’s engagements lead to the conclusion that the law, though still repressive and irrational, could be used to encourage social solidarity while respecting diversity in human norms, thus allowing the law to become a “loose framework for expressing—and enhancing—cohesion” (p. 318). This overbroad conclusion lacks content. We are left with a multidisciplinary book that intelligently analyzes the dimensions of the problem and carefully explicates the flaws of Weber, Durkheim, and Marx but breaks no new ground.</p>

         <p>
            <italic>Executing Justice</italic>is a straightforwardly abolitionist textbook. It begins with a discussion of American popular support for the death penalty, followed by an in‐depth discussion of the Willie Darden case and evaluations of the standard pro‐ and antideath penalty positions. The final chapter (and only this chapter) discusses the significance of Jesus’ death on the cross in relation to contemporary capital punishment.</p>
         <p>The heart of this book is Steffen’s defense of the Just Theory of Execution, a theory which combines elements found in the standard positions. Steffen allows that capital punishment would be just if it met nine conditions he lists, but he insists that these criteria cannot be met. For example, just execution can only be a last resort. But incarcerated murderers are no threat, so execution cannot be a last resort. Capital punishment does not meet this criterion.</p>
         <p>Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.</p>

         <p>One danger in writing a book “for students and members of the general public who wish to know what philosophers have been saying about the controversial issue of animal liberation” is that the arguments, many of which are sophisticated, will be oversimplified. The author of this volume avoids this pitfall. He is also adept (enviably so) at presenting the arguments in an impartial manner, despite having, as he puts it, “opinions on many of the issues raised” (p. 7). This shows the philosophical novice that one can be both interested (in the sense of engaged) and disinterested (in the sense of impartial).</p>
         <p>The first two chapters provide, respectively, an overview of the “main ethical approaches to the topic” (namely, rights theory, utilitarianism, contractarianism, and feminism) and a historical introduction (from Aristotle to Darwin). Chapter 3 concerns rights theory (with a focus on Tom Regan’s work), while chapter 4, ostensibly about meat eating and hunting, concerns utilitarianism (with a focus on the writings of Peter Singer and his critics, some of whom, such as R. G. Frey, come from within the utilitarian ranks). Chapter 5 addresses the use of animals in scientific research (including the burgeoning field of genetic engineering) and chapter 6 inquires into the relation between animal liberation and environmentalism. The bibliography, which occupies one‐seventh of the book, is superb.</p>
         <p>There has been a need for a volume such as this in courses in applied or practical ethics. It can be paired with<italic>Animal Liberation</italic>or<italic>The Case for Animal Rights</italic>or—if the course has a broader, multi‐issue focus—it can serve as a stand‐alone introduction to the topic of the moral status of nonhuman animals. It might also be used as an intermediary between, say,<italic>Animal Liberation</italic>(setting out a “pro” position) and Peter Carruthers’s<italic>The Animals Issue</italic>(setting out a “con” position). However it is used, the book will give students an appreciation for the power, subtlety, and fairness of philosophical analysis and criticism. The book is meticulously edited and elegantly written. Despite the depressing (and sometimes distressing) subject matter, it is a pleasure to read.</p>

            <italic>Genetic Information</italic>is an uneven, disparate collection of papers “based on an international conference of the same name, held in December, 1997, at the University of Central Lancashire” (p. vii). Papers are grouped into categories: Eugenics, Genetics and Insurance, Commercialization of Genetic Information, Public Awareness, and Theoretical Concerns. One welcome aspect of the collection is its transdisciplinary and multinational contributions. Not only will philosophers find papers by writers such as Wikler, Kuhse, Macklin, and Battin, they will find legal, empirical, and information‐giving scientific papers.</p>
         <p>The papers can surprise. Scientists from Utah (Smith, Zick, Mayer, and Botkin) present empirical information on women tested for BRCA1 gene mutation, and how this affects their purchasing behavior and attitudes toward life insurance. The mutation skyrockets a woman’s risk for breast cancer. It was stunning how little attitudes and behavior, in particular adverse selection against insurance companies by women with the mutation, changed with testing. Wikler’s is another paper with a surprise. In a style that reminds one of Parfit’s best work, Wikler builds an argument from innocuous premises to an unwelcome eugenicist conclusion on pages 11–12 that deserves attention of any philosopher interested in ethical issues posed by human genetics.</p>

         <p>Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:<italic>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</italic>and<italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest in<italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>has normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept in<italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy in<italic>The Wealth of Nations</italic>. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.</p>
