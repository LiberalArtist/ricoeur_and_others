            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">I prefer to think not that literary studies (or university education) was tragically politicized in recent decades, say since the 1960s, but that it was peculiarly depoliticized in the 1940s and 1950s as part of the “end of ideology” campaign waged during the early years of the Cold War… . In this scenario, cultural studies represents something like a return to normal after an aberrant period of reaction that tended to fetishize disembodied great works along with pure science and unending progress.

               </source>(part 1 of a two-part article on “The New Darwinism in the Humanities”), Harold Fromm lauds Pinker as among these mavericks. Interestingly though, even as he celebrates Pinker's (and E. O. Wilson's) virtuosity in crossing the science-humanities divide, he does find it necessary to qualify his praise when it comes to their aesthetic judgments:</mixed-citation>
            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">They [Pinker and Wilson] practice the consilience they recommend to others. While valuing their insights, we don't have to accept their aesthetic judgments as the last word, since the matter of “beauty” in the arts is complex. We know that the late Beethoven, late Wagner, Mahler, Stravinsky, Picasso, some of James Joyce and T. S. Eliot, etc., were at first regarded as “ugly” and now are so naturalized as to present few problems. What hasn't been assimilated—<source>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">The very fact that beauty is complex in this way, however, fundamentally undercuts Pinker's argument. See also Harold Fromm, “The New Darwinism in the Humanities, Part II: Back to Nature, Again,”<source>

Despite Levine's clarification regarding the role of the poem within a “strategic formalist” analysis, it seems telling that not only does she choose to illustrate the benefits of her method by way of a reading of a poem, but that the two responses to her essay in the<source>

               </source>critical response forum also use poems to illustrate their shared interest in reinvigorating questions of form within literary studies. As with New Criticism, the poem seems to offer an especially manageable site for the kind of close, local reading that certain variants of formalism inspire.

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">In the case of narratological, cognitive, and other data-based systems of literary criticism, the hope seems to be that literature can be analyzed within the same kinds of supposedly objective paradigms as science, and that criticism might produce findings that are verifiable and valid rather than subject to interpretation. A recent article in the<source>
                  <italic>New York Times</italic>
               </source>frames this work in the crudest of instrumental ways, asking in a sidebar, “Can combining neuroscience and Jane Austen get a literature Ph.D. a job?” (Patricia Cohen, “New Big Thing in English: Knowing They Know That You Know,”<source>
                  <italic>New York Times,</italic>
               </source>31 March 2010). More nuanced responses in the “Room for Debate” forum also, however, embody many of the key concerns and aims I have enumerated regarding the capitulation of these various movements to the status quo. Blakey Vermeule, for example, notes that younger scholars “bring a suite of skills that are fully compatible with science. They are highly tech-savvy and open to using digital techniques to mount broad, ambitious research programs.” The value of such research is that</mixed-citation>
            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">[e]nergies are distributed and results are empirical and (one hopes) testable and falsifiable… . Striking about all of this work is how practical, positive, cooperative and empirical it is. So to say that the humanities are floundering in theory's wake is misleading. The theory wars are long gone and nobody regrets their passing. What has replaced them is just what was there all along: research and scholarship, but with a new openness to scientific ideas and methods.

               </source>21, no. 3 [2010]: 112–39, quotation on 123) as the crux of their intervention and goes on to show how Best and Marcus's own description of Louis Althusser's essay on symptomatic reading “fails to describe,” “in either a complete or undistorted way” (126)—the latter descriptions being two of the key terms they use to champion surface reading. This failure is both a local one—that is, Best and Marcus's—and, more importantly, a general one, given the inability to ever simply describe anything: “[D]escription as a mode of reading doesn't work at all and … one might say, it is precisely because of the failures of description that we have something called ‘the problem of method’ in literary studies” (115).</mixed-citation>

A notable exception is Christopher Nealon's essay “Reading on the Left,” in which he distinguishes between Marxist symptomatic readings, and especially Jameson's method, and other strands of symptomatic reading, such as deconstruction and multiculturalism. Jameson, he argues, practices something more like a “hermeneutics of situation” rather than suspicion—“a kind of reading that proposes texts for our attention because they seem useful for historicizing the present” (“Reading on the Left,” in “The Way We Read Now” [see note 53], 22–50, quotation on 25)—an approach explicitly driven by the nonrevolutionary times in which he writes and the need, therefore, to “[incorporate] revolutionary failure into his system of interpretation” (24).</mixed-citation>

What she calls a “hermeneutics of susceptibility” rather than suspicion also allows, in her view, for a reading of modern abstraction that “leads us not to the separation of essence and appearance but to an animated relay between epidermal certitude and stylistic vicissitude in the making of racial legibility” (114). It is hard not to see these arguments regarding the “dynamic interface” between subject and object and its denial of any kind of “separation of essence and appearance” as a kind of dialectics manqué, which gives lie to the reductive descriptions of a Marxist hermeneutics of suspicion.</mixed-citation>

In this scheme of things, questions of value simply vanish, there being no reason why Henry James's novels are a better index to or symptom of the cultural aporias of turn-of-the-century America than the best-sellers of the period—or, for that matter, early twentieth century domestic architecture, popular periodicals, or medical treatises. Read the list of topics currently being studied by the fellows at a university humanities center and you will find that “literature” functions almost exclusively in this way: the project titles would suggest to anyone outside the academy that all the fellows come from a single department—history.

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Where it had become common for literary scholars to equate their work with political activism, the disasters and triumphs of the last decade have shown that literary criticism alone is not sufficient to effect change. This in turn raises the question of why literary criticism matters if it is not political activism by another name. (“Surface Reading,” 2)</mixed-citation>
            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">As already noted, the “failure imperative” central to any Marxist literary criticism militates against equating reading with political activism, which is not to say, however, that Best and Marcus haven't hit on the painful truth that a variety of critics were guilty of making such an equation. But whereas they want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, my contention that we must “fail better” is meant to enjoin literary criticism to be more rather than less political, to push beyond the separation between criticism and politics, in a sense akin to that advocated by Horkheimer when he refers to “[reducing] the tension” between the critic and “oppressed humanity.”</mixed-citation>

He, too, enumerates the predictable, demystifying steps that he estimates 90 percent of contemporary critics follow when they read, which he criticizes specifically in terms of the “useless” position that objects are given in these accounts. Like Sedgwick et al., he identifies the appeal of such an approach in its image of a “courageous critic” (238), who alone can expose the truth of an object, and who is “always right!” (239). Latour also links the limited possibilities for describing objects within contemporary critical models to the crisis in the humanities. As he asks,</mixed-citation>
            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Is it so surprising, after all, that with such positions given to the object, the humanities have lost the hearts of their fellow citizens, that they had to retreat year after year, entrenching themselves always further in the narrow barracks left to them by more and more stingy deans?

In his later essay on cognitive mapping, then, Jameson employs one variation of these themes, the distinction between lived experience and structure, to describe the changes that take place during the period of monopoly capitalism and the imperial expansion which accompanies it.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Heather Love sees in the “descriptive turn” the potential to unsettle the persistent humanist strain within contemporary literary criticism, which continues to predominate, she argues, despite the stated antihumanism of post-structuralism and the many theoretical models that have followed in its wake. She notes that “observation-based social sciences including ethology, kinesics, ethnomethodology, and microsociology … have developed practices of close attention, but, because they rely on description rather than interpretation, they do not engage the metaphysical and humanist concerns of hermeneutics.” They offer, she suggests, “modes of reading that are close but not deep” (<article-title>“Close But Not Deep: Literary Ethics and the Descriptive Turn,”</article-title>

As I am arguing, however, dialectical modes of reading challenge humanist claims by simultaneously allowing for and radically repositioning the place of the human rather than seemingly circumventing it through some desired form of flat description or documentary mode of reading.</mixed-citation>
