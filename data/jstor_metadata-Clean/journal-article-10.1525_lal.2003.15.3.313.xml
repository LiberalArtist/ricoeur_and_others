            <p>Abstract.<italic>Gadamer's pursuit in</italic>Truth and Method<italic>of an applicative literary hermeneutics modeled on legal hermeneutics earns him the status of a precursor to the emergence of what is known in North America as the “literature and law movement.” Attentive to the debates and controversies surrounding this movement, this article seeks to explore an interpretive interzone in which the judge and the literary critic, if they apply themselves to a poetics of elasticity, might be of exemplary significance to each other. The notion of “exemplarity” does not, however, imply a mechanical appropriation of the practices of the one by the other, but a mutually nuanced and complicated approximation of the strengths of each by the other. In the light of this normative poetics of proximity and distance, Dworkin's model of the “chain novel” is assessed and supplemented by (an alternative) model grounded in Foucault's genealogy of authorship as expounded in his article “What Is an Author?”</italic>
