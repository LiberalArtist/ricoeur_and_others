This study is concerned solely with the analysis of music structures. This is why in this
article I exclude any examination of comparisons between music and language. Even if that
exercise in comparative semiology is an essentiel prelude to the transfer of linguistics models
to the analysis of a non-linguistic phenomena such as music, this line of investigation would
take us far into other areas and back before the twentieth century. It is worth noting, how-
ever, just a few relevant contributions: Austerlitz 1983, Bierwisch 1979, Harweg 1967, 1968,
Nattiez 1975: Part 2, Pagnini 1974, Springer 1956. Equally I am excluding the issues of se-
mantics, rhetoric and musical narrativity.</mixed-citation>

Stricdy historically, phonology came into being and developed, initially, independently
of Saussure's ideas, but the opposition langue/parole on which he insisted so decisively could
not fail to provide a solid theoretical foundation for the distinction between phonetics and
phonology.</mixed-citation>

The intention in this article is to discuss the application of linguistic models to music,
and this is why I am not discussing this use of the word 'semiology', but will refer here and
there to the tripartite theory of semiology (Molino-Nattiez).</mixed-citation>

She took sonic intervais as a given in her research; had she looked at pitch instead, it
may be that there would have been less ambiguity in how some of her analytical rules are to
be applied.</mixed-citation>

In Musicology and discourse I stress repeatedly, to avoid ambiguity, the need to speak
of analysis at the neutral 'level' (Nattiez 1987, p. 34; [1990] p. 12). I am also happy to speak
of an 'immanent level'.</mixed-citation>

It is surely because this prolongational dimension was not taken on board by structu-
ral linguistics that it did not inspire research in this sense in the application of linguistic mo-
dels to music analysis. In the history of analysis in the 20th century prolongation is drawn
from other sources: from Fuxian counterpoint in Schenker, from Gestalt psychology in Me-
yer. Note that had the linguistic théories of Gustave Guillaume - inventor of a 'psycho-
mechanics of language' marginalized during the structuralist period - been studied more
widely, the situation may have been rather différent. But we can't re-write history...</mixed-citation>

With the increased use of computers in research it can be tricky to determine where
the boundary hes between generative musical grammars and an IT approach to the resolution
of musicological issues. We will not be concerned here with grammars aimed at identification
(author-verification) or those used for musical composition itself. Two sources help us to si-
tuate musical grammars in a generic sense: Computer Music Journal, IX, no. 2, 1980, and the
Proceedings of the important conférence held in Modena in 1982 (Baroni and Callegari, eds,
1984). For further information see Baroni-Dalmonte-Jacoboni 1999, p. 21, 8n.</mixed-citation>
