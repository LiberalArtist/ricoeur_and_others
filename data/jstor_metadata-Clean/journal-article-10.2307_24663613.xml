Alf Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mahäbhärata: A Reader's Guide to the Educa-
tion of the Dharma King (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001). I thank my
friends and colleagues Jonathan Chaves and Randy Kloetzli for helpful first read-
ings of this essay, and also Wendy Doniger, James Fitzgerald, and Luis Gonzales-
Reimann for helpful critiques offered in presentations and discussions at a panel
on Rethinking at the 32nd Annual South Asia Conference, Madison WI, October
2003 where a second draft was presented with only the first part of the title. It is
this panel that put the idea for the subtitle in motion.</mixed-citation>

These words are taken from an e-mail exchange with Fitzgerald of March 5,
2003, the first of several over his review. I was deliberately misquoting his abbrevi-
ation MBh. As 1 point out in Rethinking, 108, the abbreviation Mbh is preferable
to MBh since there is no evidence for a prior "Bh" outside the secondary litera-
ture.</mixed-citation>

As has been long and widely recognized, and will be discussed further below,
the avatära concept is under formation in the Mbh without yet being used as a
substantive. See Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 109 n. 56 - a note overlooked even though
it is back-referenced in a note on page 236 n. 36, a page that John Brockington
cites to criticize one of my approaches to this topic as "implausible" on the sole
stated grounds that I "show no recognition of the fact that the term [avatära] is
later than the epics"; see J. Brockington's review of Rethinking, 601.</mixed-citation>

"Many Voices" ms., 10. Fitzgerald grants in a footnote (idem, 10 n. 34) that
"main Mahäbhärata" is a "vague expression." He would seem to have coined it,
in preference to the often-used "main story," as one that admits to a text and is
thus quite different from the "main story." Schreiner, review of Rethinking, 332,
notes my usage of "main story" as "integrated... with whatever is other than
'main' (Hiltebeitel speaks of 'inner' and 'outer')." It could be clearer in his point
that the latter usages refer to "frame stories."</mixed-citation>

See Fitzgerald, "Making Yudhisthira the King," 85, thus attributing this
"rage" to his first group of epic-writing Brahmans as the motive behind their por-
trayal of his darker Yudhisthira (85-90), a dark underside that I would certainly
agree is there (see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 119-20, 135-39), but not prior to his
larger portrayal as a thoughtful, virtuous man and endearing source of occasional
light.</mixed-citation>

John Brockington, who makes bhakti excisions in the practice of oral epic
theory, says my treatment of this saree-restoration scene "includes rather spe-
cious arguments against Edgerton's text," referring to a page on which I say that
"Edgerton's choice could merely typify the eagerness of the Critical Edition's edi-
tors to excise bhakti by stripping the text" (Rethinking, 251). But Brockington does
not mention my arguments, much less show how they are specious; see his review
of Rethinking, 602. Similarly, Mary Brockington fails to indicate why she attributes
to me "unfairness to Julius Lipner (p. 257 n. 49)" in my summary of some of his
arguments on this episode: see M. Brockington, review of Rethinking, Indo-lranian
Journal 45 (2002). The references are to Franklin Edgerton, ed., Sabhäparvan. In-
troduction and Apparatus (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1944),
from the Pune Critical Edition of the Mbh, and Julius Lipner, Hindus: Their Reli-
gious Beliefs and Practices (London and New York: Routledge, 1994).</mixed-citation>

I am persuaded by Madeleine Biardeau here as regards the sequence of the
two epics, though I believe the distance in time between them is less than she pro-

This was appreciated by Sheldon Pollock, who 1 believe nonetheless made
the mistake of chronologically prioritizing the politics over the bhakti even though
he admitted that no evidence supported it; see Pollock, trans., The Rämäyana of

This was a leading subject in my "Mapping Bhakti in the Sanskrit Epics,'
presented at the 214th meeting of the American Oriental Society at San Diego,
March 2004. Here I draw on an old interest: see Hiltebeitel, Ritual of Battle,
254-66; "Brothers, Friends, and Charioteers: Parallel Episodes in the Irish and
Indian Epics," ed. Edgar C. Polom, Homage to Georges Dumézil: Journal of Indo-
European Studies Monograph, No. 3 (1982): 85-112; "The Two Krsnas on One
Chariot: Upanisadic Imagery and Epic Mythology," History of Religions 24
(1984): 1-26. As I hope to show in Mapping, friendship relates to a whole cluster
of themes that can be tied together in and around Kama, while friendship in rela-
tion to enmity is the epic ground of dvesa bhakti, "devotion by hatred," for which
the above-mentioned Sisupäla - whom Fitzgerald would like to excise from the
Mbh - is the most prominent Mbh example and, like Karna and Arjuna, a son of
one of Krsna's paternal aunts; see Georges Dumézil, Mythe et épopée, 2: Types
épiques indo-européens: un héros, un sorcier, un roi (Paris: Éditions Gallimard,
1971), 63, 65-66.</mixed-citation>

I wonder at Fitzgerald's statement that I apply "a hermeneutic lever that is
too powerful and easy to use" ("Many Voices" ms., 18) - as if interpolation and
redaction theory were made of sterner stuff. Fitzgerald makes an allied point that
excavationist and surgical approaches are economical, and believes that I argue
for joint authorship as an argument of convenience. There would, however, have
to be a correlation between convenience and economy, and I disagree that "imag-
ining the authorial agents responsible for the 'epic' to be separated in time and
interest and location" ("Many Voices" ms., 10) is the less convenient or more eco-
nomical of the options. A lot hangs on that point, but so be it. Indeed, even while
defending "excavation theories," Fitzgerald grants that one of the reasons to sus-
pect them is that "it is intellectually easier... to take something apart than it is to
find the often subtle connections that hold it together" ("Many Voices" ms., 11).</mixed-citation>

throughout the inner frame. The outer Ugrasravas-Rsis of the Naimisa Forest
frame is felt as an overhearing of the inner frame as retold from afar, whereas the
outermost Vyäsa and disciples frame is felt literally and with immediacy by Suka

"I myself am inclined to imagine the development of the Mahabharata more
along the lines of the gradual building, modification, and occasional refurbishment
of a great cathedral, under the direction of different architects and master-builders

Indeed, another is that rather than growing on trees, such designs are trees. I
have in mind here Frits Staal's discussion of "trees" as designs within Vedic ritual;
see his Ritual and Mantras: Rules without Meaning (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,
[1990] 1996, 105-8), and wish to imply that the epic's design has these ritual designs
as a familiar model. Although the discussion is of "embeddedness" (Staal, ibid.)
rather than specifically of "trees," the point is anticipated by Christopher Z. Min-
kowski, "Janamejaya's saltra and Ritual Structure," Journal of the American Orien-
tal Society 109,3 (1989): 401-20 and his "Snakes, sattras and the Mahäbhärata," in

Rethinking, 29, n. 120. I use the phrase in debating the views of Tamar
Chana Reich, "A Battlefield of a Text: Inner Textual Interpretation in the Sanskrit
Mahäbhärata," Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998:
"Granted we 'know' the Mbh as a text that 'grew, and became what it is by expan-
sion' (with italics), but not that it took eight 'centuries of textual production.'...
Reich [thinks the Mbh develops through] eight-hundred year[s]... of 'contestatory
discourse' governed by an 'aesthetic of expansion' (citing Reich 51, 32, and 31 suc-
cessively). This aesthetic better befits a short period of controlled, consensual 'con-
testation,' and also shared conventions, which do not last forever" - indeed, my
note goes on to show that "Reich sometimes points in this direction." It is in any
case the first thing I say in the book about conventions (353 [Index]).</mixed-citation>

Proposing that Mt. Mujavat, the earlier spelling of this mountain as one of
great Vedic import as the source of soma, be identified as "Muztagh Ata, (Uighur)

plex on the border of Tajikistan and Xinjiang, close to the source of the Oxus and

Other passages pertinent to this sense are 3.155.16cd and 157, in which
the "back of Himavat" is wooded and a place for hunting; 5.11.8, 9.47.41, and
12.160.31, each as a setting for narratives related to celestial movements (Seven
Rsis, Nahusa) on the back of Himavat; and 3.266.1-2 and 21, where the
Rämopäkhyäna describes Räma and Laksmana's residence on Mount Mälyavat
during the rainy season away from Kiskindhä; cf. Räm 4.27.1 and 46.10 using
prstha for their "mountain cave" (giriguha) rainy season residence (4.25.24) near
lakes and cranes, while äsinah parvatasyâgre at 4.29.5 should probably be
"seated on that foremost mountain" rather than "seated on the mountaintop,"

India, vol. 4: Kiskindhäkända (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), 118.</mixed-citation>

On slesa in "Suka," see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking the Mahabharata, 306, where
these comments apply also to Fitzgerald's advocacy ("Many Voices," 17, n. 58) of
a "straightforward" translation of the marvel of the mountains in the Suka story
as a sufficient reading. See similarly J. Brockington, Review of Rethinking the
Mahäbhärata, 601-2, on the phrase artham vicintayan in this story which suggests
both "pondering the meaning" and (as I was certainly aware) "keeping in mind
his purpose," but not "no more than" the latter.</mixed-citation>

E.g., telling a story before it happens (Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 285-86),
and usages of muhürtam, "hour," as a kind of indeterminate time-passer, an
"awhile" or "meanwhile" (72, 74, 300). One could also speak of a "doors con-
vention" (see, to begin with, n. 42 above) and a "path convention" in connec-
tion with the way each epic traces a path linking the author and the heroine
through the narratives, and most centrally through the forest books; see Hilte-
beitel, "Authorial Paths through the Two Sanskrit Epics, Via the
Rämopäkhyäna," cited above. The "path" idea is mentioned in Rethinking, 112,
n. 64.</mixed-citation>

The same term used by Vaisampayana in the Ramopakhyana's "frame story"
to describe the monkeys, bears, Pändavas, and allies of Indra (276.5-10 - four
times). On these passages, see Hiltebeitel, "Authorial Paths." Not surprisingly (see
n. 22 above), J. Brockington sees these verses as an interpolation; see J. Brocking-
ton, The Sanskrit Epics, Handbuch der Orientalistik, Zweite Abteilung, Indien,
Vol. 12, J. Bronkhorst, ed. (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1998), 476. Considering the
Ramopäkyäna as subsequent to the Rämäyana (a matter I cannot take up here,
but on which I do not agree), Brockington takes these Rämopäkhyäna /Mbh verses
as indicative of growth subsequent to the Rämäyana's "second stage," arguing that
they are "[t]he sole exception" to Rama being mainly a human and exemplary fig-
ure, "the position reached in the middle of the second stage of growth of the
Rämäyana." He finds it "the more significant that the Rämopäkhyäna does not
allude to Rama's divinity in its closing chapter." But it is hard not to read
Brahma's closing words there as just such an allusion: "Like an immortal, you
have accomplished a great feat of the gods (krtam tvayä mahatkäryam devänäm
amaraprabhd)" (3.275.34cd). In any case, it is in the same adhyäya that Rama is
soon consecrated "the vaisnava hero" (65). For similar comments ("the only
exception"), see also J. Brockington, Epic Threads: John Brockington on the San-
skrit Epics, Greg Bailey and Mary Brockington, eds. (New Delhi: Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 2000), 300.</mixed-citation>

The superfluity arises from the fact that this "double of Krsna" never has to
take the reins, since Nala is driving; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 232-33. As men-
tioned in n. 7 above, J. Brockington finds this "implausible." For valuable discus-
sion of the "avatära" theme in both epics, and especially in the Rämäyam, see
also Robert P. Goldman and Sally J. Sutherland, trans. The Rämäyam of Välmlki,
Vol. 5: Sundarakäyanda (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), 29-33, 69,
