In the research I did for this paper, I was repeatedly amazed at the number of times I
found myself mentally reversing myself in some criticism of Dooyeweerd when I discovered
that his rationale resulted from a much deeper penetration of an issue that I at first could
possibly suspect. I am therefore very conscious of the possibility that I could be entirely
mistaken on certain points.</mixed-citation>

Indeed, Dooyeweerd in some contexts seems to suggest this, which would conflict
fundamentally with the implications of his belief in the resurrection of the body. Reporting
on a conversation with Dooyeweerd in Amsterdam in June, 1964, Steen says that he asked
Dooyeweerd "whether he thought that the fact that Paul speaks of faith abiding in I Cor. 13
after the judgment day, had any bearing on whether the function of faith would abide after
judgment. Dooyeweerd gave an interesting reply. First he said, 'faith turns into sight and
therefore faith passes away.' When I mentioned the fact that Paul emphasizes that faith
abides, he stressed the fact that we really know nothing about the future after the judgment.
When I then asked how it would be possible to conceive of a resurrected man without all the
functions and the law spheres holding, he seemed to reconsider his previous statement and
agree that I was laying my finger on an important point." (Steen, Structure, p. 85)</mixed-citation>

Steen indicates that the term "above time" (boventijdelijk) was abandoned by Dooyeweerd
in his later years under intense criticism, in favor of the expression "religious transcendence."
Yet, according to Steen, this substitution by no means represented a change in Dooyeweerd's
own understanding of the whole structure to which the former term applied, but rather a
concession to what he regarded as a misunderstanding that had arisen concerning the whole
complex of ideas involved. (Structure, p. 6, n. 6).</mixed-citation>

I am assuming here the correlativity of what Steen calls "Word-revelation" and
"creational revelation" (Structure, p. 304), or what has been traditionally called "special
revelation" and "general revelation." One of the best accounts of this correlation I know of is
found in G.C. Berkouwer, General Revelation, Studies in Dogmatics, trans, ed. (Grand Rapids:

TM, XXIX, XXXII. Steen says "it appears that Dooyeweerd is saying that the human race
as a totality represented in Adam and Eve (stamvader en stammoeder) was created by God in
the beginning. All that will unfold and be subject to the temporal process of becoming is
present here as finished creation. There would seem to be a root community of hearts
represented in the heart of the first representative root, Adam." (Structure, p. 65)</mixed-citation>

Steen observes: "Dooyeweerd intimates that reality as it exists through temporal be-
coming and supra-temporal generation had a pre-existence in the Spirit of God; it exists as
created, as finished creation. It is this finished existing creation that now becomes in the great
becoming process." (Structure, p. 66f., cf. p. 52f.) One might wish to ask, then: What is the
supra-temporal existence of the soul? (On the concept of aevum, or created eternity, in
Dooyeweerd, see his "Het tijdsprobleem en zijn antinomieÃ«n op het immanentie-standpunt,"

The fact that the generation of both soul (supra-temporally) and body (temporally) derive
from the pre-existence of the already created whole man, understood as entirely contained in
the heart or soul as the radical religious root of personality, underscores the claims of those
who, following Vollenhoven's problem-historical method, find some sort of "priority theme"
or "monarchian" element in Dooyeweerd's thinking, along with some variety of "instru-
mentalism" and "impetus theory" (see, e.g., Vollenhoven's "De consequent probleem-

H. Dooyeweerd, "Calvinistische Wijsbegeerte," Scientia 1 (1956), 144; quoted in G.C.
Berkouwer, Man: The Image of God, Studies in Dogmatics, trans. Dirk W. Jellema (Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962), p. 258; henceforth cited as "Man." See Dooyeweerd's comparable
statement in NC, I, 21, where he uses "philosophical" instead of "theoretical" thought; and cf.
TM, VI, on the presuppositional nature of the soul in human theorizing.
The parallels with Scheler's view of the "person" are remarkable here. Much as in
Dooyeweerd's view the "soul" or "heart" can never be objectified, so for Scheler the "person"
can never become an object of analysis; much as in Dooyeweerd's view "acts" come forth out
of the soul but only function within the temporal structure of the human body, so for Scheler
the person acts into time without himself being in time. For Scheler's distinction between
"acts" and "functions," and significant differences in his view of the act-structure, see Max
Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die Materiale Wertethik, Gesammelte Werke, Vol;. II, ed.
Maria Scheler (Bern: Francke Verlag, 1954), pp. 395ff.; translated as Formalism in Ethics and
No7t-Formal Ethics of Values (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 385ff. For
the comparable views of Dooyeweerd, see TM XIV and XX, for example. It is possible that
both Dooyeweerd's and Scheler's view of the non-objectifiability of the essential selfhood of
the person is the result of a residual Kantianism.</mixed-citation>

Steen, despite noting Dooyeweerd's development of "a unique aversion towards citing
proof-texts in his works" as a result of his early confrontations with Reformed theologians,
and despite noting Dooyeweerd's consequent failure to appreciate the rich discovery of
Scripture in recent developments within the exegetical branches of theology, and despite
noting that this may be (ironically) part of the reason for a residuum of nature-grace
influence in his philosophy, nevertheless speaks of "the rich biblical emphasis... always

God (Job 1: 6-12); his act of rebellion against God (Is. 14: 12-15); the rich man in Hades

Although Dooyeweerd says that "all human acts have their origin in the soul," and
therefore beyond time, he holds that they function only within the temporal structure of the
human body (TM, XX; cf XIV). For this reason he opposes the phenomenology of Husserl and
Scheler, which regards acts as "incorporeal (onlichamelijk), (pure 'psychonomic') intentional
experiences" (TM, XV).</mixed-citation>

On the "participation idea" see Steen, Structure, p. 209; on the collapse of structure into
direction see Ibid., p. 83, where Steen writes: "It might be said that structure tends to be
reduced to direction... Structure is transcendentally-directed meaning. Meaninglessness,
nothing, and meaning loss tend to occur when this direction is lost. The structure is almost its
pointing character." Steen finds in this state of affairs what he calls the "semi-contradictory

Scheler's position is precariously subtle: the "person" is neither exhausted in his "acts"
nor something subsisting through their temporal succession, but, rather, a supra-temporal
being who acts into time and who "is and experiences himself only as a being that executes
acts"; the "whole person is contained in every fully concrete act, and the whole person 'varies' in
and through every act - without being exhausted in his being in any of these acts, and
without 'changing' like a thing in time" (Formalismus, p. 395f. [English translation, p. 385]; see

In this context, Dooyeweerd's reading of Stoker seems misleading. When Stoker suggests
that his concept of substance gives a better expression to "the autonomous being and value of
the cosmos with respect to God" {die eien zijn en die eienwaarde van die kosmos teenover God),
Dooyeweerd fears that the radical biblical view of the dependence of all creation upon God is
somehow being threatened (NC, III, 71). But this overlooks precisely the point Stoker is
affirming: namely, the real difference instituted between the Creator and His creation by the
very act of creating. Accordingly, creation is not self-sufficient; but it is not nothing; it is
something. (Cf. Zigterman, op.cit., pp. 129,132,136.)</mixed-citation>
