The reference is to Slotkin's important trilogy, consisting of
Regeneration through Violence ( 1973), The Fatal Environment (1985),
and Gunfighter Nation (1992), where he demonstrates exhaustively
the multifold ways in which frontier drams have been repeatedly
mythicized to secure "national" American sensibilities at distinct
historical junctures.</mixed-citation>

An anonymous reviewer of an earlier draft of this essay reminds me
rightly that the westerns Eastwood starred in with Leone and after were
hardly endorsements of American values. Rather, in their historical
abstractions, pointed amorality, and excessive violence, such works
marked a "post-modern" or existential turn away from the Cold War
ideologies of a revitalized "American" social ethic in the westerns John
Wayne made with John Ford and Howard Hawks. Consequently, it is
with some irony or historical amnesia that Eastwood's iconic status
was marked as "American" at the Republican National Convention,
when Eastwood came on stage to the musical accompaniment of
Ennio Morricone's famous score, Eastwood's "man-with-no-name"
character silhouetted in a projection behind him. Those were not, at
the time, viewed as "patriotic" iconographies.</mixed-citation>

Perhaps the most powerful and poignant film interrogating the heroic
capacities of the aged is Joel and Ethan Coen's No Countryfor Old Men
(2007). Based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, which appropriates
the opening line from the Yeats' poem, "Sailing to Byzantium" for its
title, No Country for Old Men laments the ineffectual retreat of the
aging hero, Sherriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in the face of the chaotic
and unfathomable violence that has come to dominate the country
along the borderlands of West Texas.</mixed-citation>

The evocative nicknames of well-known older activists and
artists—Mother Jones, Granny D, Grandma Moses—signal the
complex rhetorical machinations of the particular gender bias at work
here. Imagery of vigor in older (and particularly in so-called "post
menopausal") women must be at once detached from the biological
reproductive capacity in which representations of women are still
socially ensconced and at the same time, paradoxically, rearticulated
in alignment with women's supposedly "maternal" social roles.</mixed-citation>

Eastwood's promotional advertisement for Chrysler, "Halftime in
America," which aired during the 2012 Super Bowl, was also much
panned for its incoherence. In this spot, however, the Eastwood
persona is linked to a concern for blue-collar jobs in the automobile
industry (in Detroit, explicitly) and the critical need to revitalize the
American dream of securing upward mobility through labor. There is
no doubt some irony in the fact that the bailout of the industry was one
of President Obama's signature achievements during his first term.</mixed-citation>

Of Unforgiven, Dennis Bingham writes that it unveils the oppressive
impostures of masculinity that had hitherto been reinforced in
Eastwood's performances: "It is clear that 'Clint Eastwood' will not
'mean' the same again. Nor, perhaps, will masculinity. The mask is
off and the face underneath is a woman's—scarred, covered with
worms—the victim of male insecurity masquerading as power and
strength. The face is also a man's, his eyes opened by the recognition
of centuries of oppression caused by white male privilege" (243).</mixed-citation>

"American literature operates according to geographical lines," writes
Gilles Deleuze in "On the Superiority of Anglo-American Literature."
"The flight towards the West, the discovery that the true East is in the
West, the sense that frontiers are something to cross, to push back, to
go beyond. The becoming is geographical" (37).</mixed-citation>

The two most recent Eastwood films, as I write, are also meditations
on age and masculinity. The vastly underappreciated J. Edgar (2011)
underscores the comic book and fictive nature of masculine violence,
showing how the insecure Hoover re-scripts arrests so that he can
play the role of hero according to the logic of comic books and boys
adventures stories. The film also depicts the travails of age, I believe,
with considerable sympathy, as the monstrous character, in his dotage,
is still presented as lonely man in need of love. Trouble with the Curve
(2012), directed by Robert Lorenz, also had a dispiriting reception,
no doubt affected by Eastwood's Republican National Convention
performance. In another variation on the Lear narrative, Eastwood's
crotchety baseball scout Gus Lobel is challenged to reconsider his
legacy in the face of a changing game and the difficulties of a renewed
relationship with his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams).</mixed-citation>

Though I have not space in this essay to consider either film in any
detail, Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers (2006) and its "sequel" Letters
from Iwo Jima (2006) are unsentimental studies of masculinity and
valor in battle that neither celebrate nor condemn military violence.</mixed-citation>
