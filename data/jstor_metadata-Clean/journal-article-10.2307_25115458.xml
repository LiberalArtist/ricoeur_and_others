         <abstract>
            <p>What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.</p>

Susan Stewart says, "by insisting upon a

Rukeyser's approach too easily condones war—that it resem-
bles a quiescent psychological "adjustment" to war as an inevitability—she answers
that concern by expressing the critical difference between compliant passivity and
active witnessing:". . . the word is not 'adjusted,' which implies a static condition to
be adjusted to; the word is 'full-valued,' which accepts a world of process, a dynam-
ic universe of time and growth relations" (1996, 56).</mixed-citation>

his 1958 essay "The Shadow of the Gods," Arthur Miller criticizes mod-
ern drama for its sameness of plot and emotion and for "not doing enough" on two
counts: modern drama fails "to extend itself so as to open up ultimate causes" rath-
er than mere individual "affects," and it fails to "set its art works fully in view of the
question of the survival of the race" (1961, 483).</mixed-citation>
