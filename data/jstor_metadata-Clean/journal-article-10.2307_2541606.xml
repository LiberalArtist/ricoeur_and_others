         <abstract>
            <p>From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.</p>
