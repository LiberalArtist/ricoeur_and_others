Abrams, "empathy" signifies "a spectator's
identification with a person or object," with an emphasis on physiological effects, while sympathy is
"not a feeling-into, but a feeling-along-with the state of mind and emotions of another human being"

Smith's discussion of sympathy with the dead is perhaps the strongest proof that abstraction, along
with "otherness," is required: as with fictional characters, we can sympathize with the non-living
corpse not by feeling what it feels (which is nothing) but by an "illusion of the imagination," through
an "idea of that dreary and endless melancholy" we only imagine it feeling (9).</mixed-citation>

Smith writes: "To see the emotions of [others'] hearts in every respect beat time to his own, in the vi-
olent and disagreeable passions, constitutes his sole consolation. But he can only hope to obtain this
by lowering his passion to that pitch, in which the spectators are capable of going along with him. He
must flatten ... the sharpness of its natural tone, in order to reduce it to harmony and concord with the
emotions of those around him" (23).</mixed-citation>

Smith
adds, "[w]hat they feel will, indeed, always be in some respects different from what he feels ... be-
cause the secret consciousness that the change of situations, from which the sympathetic sentiment
arises, is but imaginary, not only lowers it in degree, but in some measure varies it in kind, and gives
it a quite different modification" (23).</mixed-citation>

Smith's originality, Duncan continues, "lies in the recognition of a subject-formation that takes place
through the techniques of literacy, and is dialogical in its operation: the activation of 'sentiment' oc-
curs in a sympathetic transaction between the representation and the reader or audience, as opposed to
its being found 'in' either the text or the reader's psychology" (47).</mixed-citation>

Chandler writes that the case form—"associated at once with agency, judgment, and normativity, on
the one hand, and with the working through of contradiction, on the other"—is a formal principle me-
diating between normative and descriptive orders, and thus bears the "very form of 'deliberation'"
(England 209).</mixed-citation>

Dames, Eliot was at the center of "the theoretical terrain we might now call 'temporal
form'" (127): narrative form (in Daniel Deronda) is "temporalized," "time itself an aesthetic and psy-
chological problem" signaled in the novel's experiments with "lastingness," both formal and concep-
tual (the latter, those affiliations—racial, national, religious—"that stretch beyond merely
biographical frame times") (128).</mixed-citation>

Eagleton suggests that it is the very deathlessness of the narrative that
betrays the particular (and particularly modern) "curse of omniscience," here "the epistemological
circle of a bourgeois science which threatens to swallow the whole of Nature down its ravenous maw
and so ends up knowing only its innards" (60).</mixed-citation>
