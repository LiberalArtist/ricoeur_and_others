Stange commenting in a
review of a recent edition of the novel in 1979 that "no one has recently claimed that [No Name]
was a finer novel than The Moonstone or The Woman in White. And yet, reading No Name again,
necessarily in the light of our present preoccupations with the theory of fiction, I have come to feel
that it displays more clearly and more compendiously than the better-known novels what now appears
to be the distinctive interest of Collins's work" (96).</mixed-citation>

Stange considers these intrigues to be the main interest in the story: "Collins is at his most exuberant
in handling the continually inspissating pattern of intrigue that dominates the middle section of the
novel_[T]he reader's interest is not in the outcome of the main plot but in the succession of plots
and counterplots the characters devise to ensnare each other. It would not be far wrong to say that the
subject of No Name is plotting. It is a tale of trappers trapping trappers, devised by a novelist who, we
are continually reminded, is himself an addictive contriver" (97).</mixed-citation>

Mary Louise Pratt holds that the "lone pairs of speakers and hearers are generally taken in speech-
act theory to be much more monolithic entities than people really are. In fact, the speakers and
hearers of traditional speech-act theory are clear instances of the notorious unified subject... Speech-
act theory... supposes the existence... of an authentic, self-consistent, essential subject, a 'true
self ... It's all a matter, as Austin loved to say, of a man's (sic) word being his bond. The idea
is of an authentic self, fully realized through speech, and speech fully adequate to the self -
speech from the heart. Derrida's critique of speech-act theory addresses this aspect of the theory"

1876, Trollope in his Autobiography writes, "Among English novels of the present day, and
among English novelists, a great division is made. There are sensational novels and anti-sensational,
sensational novelists and anti-sensational; sensational readers and anti-sensational. The novelists who
are considered to be anti-sensational are generally called realistic. I am realistic. My friend Wilkie
Collins is generally supposed to be sensational. The readers who prefer the one are supposed to take
delight in the elucidation of character. They who hold by the other are charmed by the construction and
gradual development of a plot. All this is, I think, a mistake, - which mistake arises from the inability
of the imperfect artist to be at the same time realistic and sensational. A good novel should be both,
and both in the highest degree. If a novel fail in either, there is a failure in Art_Let an author so tell
his tale as to touch his reader's heart and draw his tears, and he has, so far, done his work well. Truth
let there be, - truth of description, truth of character, human truth as to men and women. If there be
such truth, I do not know that a novel can be too sensational." (226-29)</mixed-citation>

Michie - in her discussion of the way in which "Fallen sisters ... are frequently recoupable through
their sisters' efforts" in both Rossetti's "Goblin Market" and No Name - suggests there to be in
Collins's recourse to private theatricals a covert tie to domestic fiction, specifically to the fictions of
Jane Austen: "Amateur theatricals are used, of course, from Mansfield Park onward, as vehicles for
the expression of inappropriate erotic feelings" (404 and 412).</mixed-citation>

Magdalen is foreshadowed when the narrative has Miss Garth look in on the
tableau of the future star of the Marrables' play preparing for her role: "There sat Magdalen, in an
arm-chair before the long looking-glass, with all her hair let down over her shoulders; absorbed in the
study of her part_And there behind her sat the lady's-maid, slowly combing out the long heavy
locks of her young mistress's hair, with the sleepy resignation of a woman who had been engaged in
that employment for some hours past_The luxurious tranquillity of the scene; the cool fragrance
of flowers and perfumes in the atmosphere; the rapt attitude of Magdalen, absorbed over her reading;
the monotonous regularity of movement in the maid's hand and arm, as she drew the comb smoothly
through and through her mistress's hair - all conveyed the same soothing impression of drowsy
delicious quiet" (39).</mixed-citation>
