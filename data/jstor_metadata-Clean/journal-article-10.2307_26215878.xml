A rather different version of this paper will appear as part of the introductory chapter of
my Political Theory, Modernity and Postmodernity: Beyond Enlightenment and Critique
(Oxford, 1994). In its original form the article has benefited from the critical comments of
Terrell Carver and Iain Hampsher-Monk, and from discussions with Judith Squires, Bonnie
Honig, John Charvet, Chris Brown, Ian Forbes, Brian Barry, Chris Bertram and, especially,
Onora O'Neill. A heartfelt thank you to one and all.</mixed-citation>

The revival of substantive political theory in what is usually called an 'Anglo-American'
mode, is widely held to have been sent into overdrive by the publication of John Rawls' Î›
Theory of Justice (Oxford, 1972) and the launching of the journal Philosophy and Public
Affairs in 1971. As Barry remarks in 'The Strange Death of Political Philosophy', the
rebirth of analytical political theory also benefited from much work in political economy
and economics, especially that in game theory and other forms of formal theory. Recent
representative selections of analytical political theory in this vein would include: Alan
Hamlin and Philip Pettit, The Good Polity: Normative Analysis of the State (Oxford, 1989);
John Broome, Weighing Goods (Oxford, 1992); Will Kymlicka, Liberalism, Community
and Culture (Oxford, 1991); and Brian Barry, Theories of Justice (Vol. 1 of A Treatise of
Social Justice) (Hemel Hempstead, 1989).</mixed-citation>

Consider, for example, the work in the United States of scholars like Leo Strauss,
Reinhold Niebuhr and Hannah Arendt. In France of Raymond Aron, Alexandre Kojeve,
Louis Althusser and Paul Ricoeur. In Germany, of Adomo and Horkheimer, Habermas and
Gadamer. In Italy of Norberto Bobbio and in the UK of Michael Oakeshott, John Plamenatz
and Isaiah Berlin. It is fair to say, of course, that much of this work was done in the history
of ideas, a point recognized by the likes of Barry and Miller. Their point is precisely that it
was non-historical substantive political theory that was 'dead'. It is also true to say that
'political theory' as it is usually practised in the Anglo-American worlds is slightly
different from cognate activities on mainland Europe. However, most of the above men-
tioned writers (and indeed many others) were certainly not exclusively concerned with the
history of ideas or had a conception of political philosophy that saw the history of ideas as
a crucial component of any substantive theory. This was certainly the view of, for example,
Strauss, Gadamer and Oakeshott, though naturally in different ways. This might be
incorrect; it does not, however, suggest that political philosophy was 'dead'.</mixed-citation>

I shall refer throughout this paper to the kind of political theory that has, allegedly, been
'reborn' as 'Anglo-American' political theory, a common enough terminology these days.
I should emphasize, however, that this term should be taken to refer to a way of doing
political theory and the assumptions associated with it, rather than having any specific
geographical referent. Thus (and for example), Phillipe Van Parijs, who teaches in Bel-
gium, does on my account 'Anglo-American political theory' whereas William Connolly,
who teaches in America, does not.</mixed-citation>

This latter point is the hallmark, of course, of Quentin Skinner and J.G. A. Pocock as well
as Dunn, with whom I shall be principally concerned in this paper. See Meaning and
Context: Quentin Skinner and His Critics, ed. James Tully (Cambridge, 1988). For a good
general survey of competing methods in the history of political thought see The History of
Ideas, ed. Preston King (London, 1983). In addition to the Cambridge school, as the work
of Skinner, Pocock and Dunn has sometimes been characterized, there is some analogous
(though often different) work being done in Europe, especially in Germany. See, for
example, the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historiches lexikon zur politische- sozialen
Sprache in Deutschland, ed. Otto Bruner, Werner Conze and Reinhart Koselleck (5 vols,
to date: Stuttgart, 1972- ). For a general discussion of the similar yet differing versions of
the 'historical turn' in the history of political thought see Melvin Richter, 'Reconstructing
the History of Political Languages: Pocock, Skinner and the Geschlichtliche Grundbe-
griffe', History and Theory, Vol. XXIX, no. 1 (1990), pp. 38-70.</mixed-citation>

This is not the place to go over the many and variegated turns of the realist vs. anti-realist
argument in twentieth-century philosophy. Suffice to say that as opposed to the realist view
which sees fixed, determinate existing objects for social investigations, anti-realism sug-
gests that there are only particular interpretations or assumptions embedded in still further
assumptions, and so on. The assumptions of anti-realist arguments are clearly compatible
with the emphasis on context of Dunn and others of the Cambridge school. There are, of
course, a wide number of possible anti-realist views (as there are realist views) and one
should not assume that Dunn would subscribe to them all.</mixed-citation>

Of course, the techniques and assumptions that are used by (amongst others) rational
choice theorists are deployed in a wide variety of ways by different theorists. Here I do not
mean to imply anything other than the fact that Dunn's usage of 'prudence' is very different
from the general sense these theorists would give to the term 'rational', with the instru-
mental sense of which it might be confused.</mixed-citation>

I am, I know, sidestepping the complex and important question of whether all so-called
postmodern readings of politics actually do this. I accept that some are much better disposed
to Dunn's sort of history than others. In the article on postmodem political theory cited
earlier (Rengger, 'No Time Like The Present?'), and in the book from which both that
article and this are drawn, I drew a distinction between 'hard' sceptical postmodems such
as Jean Baudrillard and soft sceptical postmodems such as William Connolly. In the present
context the latter would be more likely to be sympathetic to Dunn's argument than the
former.</mixed-citation>

The four most frequently cited communitarians, of course. See Charles Taylor, Sources
of The Se//(Cambridge, Mass., 1989); Michael Sandel, Liberalism and the Limits of Justice
(Cambridge, 1983); Michael Walzer, Spheres of Justice (New York, 1983); Alisdair
Maclntyre, After Virtue (London, 1981). It is worth pointing out, I think, that linking these
four in this way does grave damage to all of the thinkers concerned. Of the four just
mentioned only two, Walzer and Sandel, seem unworried by the use of the label 'commu-
nitarian' (which is more usually and â€” in some senses appropriately â€” applied to writers
such as Amitai Etzioni). Maclntyre has expressly repudiated the idea that he is a commu-
nitarian (see his 'Reply to my Critics', in After Maclntyre, ed. Susan Mendus and John
Horton (Cambridge, 1994)) and Taylor has also expressed his very considerable reserva-
tions (in his 'Cross Purposes: The Liberal-Communitarian debate', in Liberalism and the
Moral Life, ed. Nancy Rosenblum (Cambridge, Mass., 1989)). I discuss this problem in
more detail in Political Theory, Modernity and Postmodemity, especially in the introduc-
tion and Ch. 4.</mixed-citation>

See Quentin Skinner, On Justice, The Common Good and Liberty', in Dimensions of
Radical Democracy: Pluralism, Citizenship, Community, ed. Chantai Mouffe (London,
1992). Skinner and Pocock have been especially influential of course in bringing the
republican tradition into greater focus over the last few years. Given the complicated
history of the relations between liberal and republican thought that they so well document,
it is nicely ironic that they seek to attack versions of modern liberalism with weapons taken
from a tradition so deeply, if ambiguously, implicated in its development. It is also worth
pointing out here, however, that 'republicanism' as such has also been 'revived' (if that is
quite the word) by some scholars who hardy share either the methodological or the
normative agenda's of the Cambridge school, to wit some of the friends and allies of Leo
Strauss, especially Harvey Mansfield and Thomas Pangle (see, for example, Mansfield's
Taming the Prince: The Ambivalence of Modern Executive Power (Baltimore, 1989) and
Pangle's The Spirit of Modern Republicanism (Chicago, 1988)). I do not propose to argue
the toss between the Cambridge school and Straussian versions of 'republicanism' here, I
merely point out that this is contested ground.</mixed-citation>

It is also common to writers connected to the Cambridge school. Richard Tuck, for
example, in his recent and excellent Philosophy and Government 1572-1651 (Cambridge,
1993), provides a slightly different but nonetheless related account of the rise of a particular
set of political assumptions that created at least some aspects of the origins of contemporary
liberalism. Again, however, it is worth noting the similarity (in form, not content) of what
we might call the 'Straussian republicans' Mansfield and Pangle'. Mansfield begins his
account of the rise of the modern executive with Machiavelli, and in doing so explicitly
feels the need to distance his interpretation from that of Skinner and Pocock (see Mansfield,
Taming the Prince, pp. xxiii-xxiv), and the subtitle of Pangle's book is 'The Moral Vision
of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke'. As with Dunn and Skinner it is
with interpretations of Machiavelli and Locke that the critique of existing liberalism begins.</mixed-citation>

A claim associated with Leo Strauss, but one that could with some amendment of

more popular, even among analytical theorists, for example Jon Elster. See, amongst many

Much the same is true of those 'Utopian realists' who, I suggested earlier, in this respect
at least make common cause with Dunn. Giddens, for example, insists that we must
'balance Utopian ideals with realism' given the extremely high-consequence risks of
contemporary social life, echoing Dunn's insistence on the complexity and risk inherent in
modernity, and Booth stresses that his utopianism is not an end-point Utopia but a process
Utopia, agreeing with Dunn's concern that the third task of political theory is to conceive
of realistic ways of getting from where we are to where we might, and should, aim to be.</mixed-citation>

There are, of course, discussions of this sort in a variety of modern moral and political
theories. For example Onora O'Neill has given accounts of this issue from a strongly
Kantian perspective, and the notion of reasonableness and what it leads to plays a central
role in John Finnis's influential rearticulation of Natural Law theory. See Onora O'Neill,
'Vindicating Reason', in The Cambridge Companion to Kant, ed. Paul Guyer (Cambridge,
1992); and John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Oxford, 1980). The beginnings
of my own approach to this question can be found in Political Theory, Modernity and

It is partly to avoid such a difficulty, of course, that Habermas (just to give one other
example) develops his theory of communicative action. Unfortunately I am unconvinced
by this argument also, for all its hugely impressive grasp and range. See Jtirgen Habermas,
ThÃ©orie des kommunikativen Handelns. Baud 1, Handlungsrationalitat und gesell-
schaftliche Rationalisierung. Baud 2, Î–urKritik derfunktioalistischen Vernunft (Frankfurt,
1981). See also Ch. 2 of Political Theory, Modernity and Postmodernity for a brief
discussion of Habermas. I am currently working on a more thorough treatment of the
reasons for my doubts in a paper: 'Negative Dialectic? Globalization and the Future of
Critical Theory'.</mixed-citation>
