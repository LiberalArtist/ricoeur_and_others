         <abstract>
            <p>Willa Cather's famous Virgilian epigraph to My Ántonia alerts the reader to the novel's deep engagement with the Georgics. This paper advocates a positive interpretation of the relationship between the two by exploring the role of the poem in the life and "memoirs" of Jim Burden, the novel's narrator. In contrast to currently received notions about the poem's "pastoralizing" influence, it argues that the Georgics illumines the Nebraska prairie and the farmers who toiled there, enabling Jim to perceive and articulate their vitality and worth. Through Jim's story of remembrance and return, Cather ultimately presents the literary tradition, and the Georgics in particular, as a beneficent force capable of creating connections among human beings, the natural world, the past and present.</p>

Ántonia: "We have this flower very much at home, in the old country. It always
grew in our yard and my papa had a green bench and a table under the bushes. In summer,
when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with his friend that played the trombone.
When I was little I used to go down there to hear them talk-beautiful talk, like what I never
hear in this country.' 'What did they talk about?' I asked her.... 'Oh, I don't know! About
music, and the woods, and about God, and when they were young'" (228)</mixed-citation>
