Lukács writes that there are two primary dangers of the novel's aesthetic strategy: "ei-
ther the fragility of the world may manifest itself so crudely that it will cancel out the
immanence of meaning which the form demands, or else the longing for the disso-
nance to be resolved, affirmed and absorbed into the work may be so great that it will
lead to a premature closing of the circle of the novel's world, causing the form to dis-
integrate into disparate, heterogeneous parts" (Theory 71-72).</mixed-citation>

Jameson, in his reading of Theory of the Novel, evocatively writes, "a hybrid form
which must be reinvented at every moment of its development. Each novel is a process
in which the very possibility of narration must begin in a void, without any acquired
momentum: its privileged subject matter will therefore be the search, in a world in
which neither goals nor paths are established beforehand" (Marxism 172)</mixed-citation>

John Frow, "Lukács is thinking in terms of a spiralling historical move-
ment. Thus each phase is at once progressive and yet runs parallel to a previous phase

ahistorical model of realism" (10)</mixed-citation>

Frow rightly points out, "In the later Lukács the notion of historical recurrence
seems increasingly to have led him to ignore the moment of negativity he had recog-
nized in the novel. History itself loses its uncertainty and its formlessness ... An ethi-
cal-aesthetic valuation (realism/decadence) replaces the morally neutral categories of
The Theory of the Novel, and the bourgeois historical novel becomes . . . a new mani-
festation of wholeness . . . [But] if novelists can no longer discover meaning, this is
nevertheless primarily a moral failing on their part, not the result of an objective social
process" (11)</mixed-citation>

Frow has argued, "Literature is not a conventional order of discourse; rather, lit-

iconic sign: it is natural, motivated, mirroring a sense which is independent of its in-
