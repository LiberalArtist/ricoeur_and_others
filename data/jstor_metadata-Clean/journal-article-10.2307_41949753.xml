"Of Minimal Things is thus not about relation as philosophy's founding
category, nor about relation as the theme that defines it. In a way, it is not about
relation at all.... [I]ts concern is with 'something' that is more minimal than
relation, with 'something' from which even the thing 'relation,' however minimal and
elementary it is in its intraphilosophical sense, derives its possibility and meaning"

"Since this foam of virtual participles is a foam of participles popping in and out
of existence, it itself has not the presence of an object, and hence also requires a
discursive approach distinct from the philosophical language of the hard sciences,
a kind of speculation, and philosophical thinking, without the conceptual and
ontological assurances of traditional philosophical thought" (2007b, 80; my emphasis)</mixed-citation>

The Honor of Thinking entitled "Under the Heading of Theory," Gasché
writes: "those critics who, in the name of theory, apply the insights from various
other disciplines in the humanities such as sociology, linguistics, or psychoanalysis
to literary texts have little, except the umbrella term 'theory,' in common with the
rhetorical and tropologica! brand of deconstruction" (2007a, 147).</mixed-citation>

"I do not speak here of philosophy as an academic discipline.
As such a discipline, it can continue eternally without being alive. What is at stake,
rather, is philosophy as an active mode of critically questioning what is the case, and
of relating, be it in wonder or in horror, that something is the case" (2007b, 132-33).</mixed-citation>

"Precisely because Europe
is the name for universality, that is, for an openness and exposure to the other, the
very injunctions that constitute universality also require that this name, as a proper
and singular name, and as a name of singularity, be abandoned" (2009, 344).</mixed-citation>

Gasché writes in The Honor of Thinking, "the dignity or nobility that the human being
as a moral being capable of reason can lay claim to is that of universal mankind.
Dignity and nobility are, thus, terms that indicate universal rank" (2007a, 3).</mixed-citation>

"No one has more perseveringly
questioned the most blinding evidences of philosophical tradition as well as of
common sense than Derrida.... no philosopher, no thinker, hitherto, has been so
uncompromisingly vigilant as he has been.... This formidable alertness is not only
what constitutes the singularity of Derrida's thought, it is also one of the universal
traits, and, therefore, I hold, the memory of Derrida to which we must respond, and to
which we can respond responsibly only by affirming the injunction that such vigilance
represents" (2007b, 8).</mixed-citation>

"in the very name of clarity, the Enlightenment will have to
abandon its desire for light with all its inherent apocalyptic mystifications for the
benefit of a 'new, very new Aufklärung,' by which more light is shed on demystifying
clarity" (2007b, 15-16).</mixed-citation>
