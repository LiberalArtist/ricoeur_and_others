         <abstract>
            <p>Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.</p>

Rowe encounters, in the forum of
practical criticism, a difficulty that has served to
animate extensive debate in Critical Inquiry and New
Literary History. On the one hand, he wants to regard
the interpretive activity of The Education as a "pattern
of deconstructive creation" generating possibilities and
the disclosure of supplementary meanings. On the other,
he does not characterize the play of signification as
much of an achievement, for it requires gambling "in an  </mixed-citation>

Adams' imagina-
tive ("symbolic") achievement when he shifts attention
from the text's failed systemics and renegade language
to Adams as a historical figure and to his own
expectations as a reader of The Education. "The
enormous effort of composition and recollection seems
to deny that the mind is a mere particle in a sea of
supersensuous chaos. Cutting and piecing together the
history of his education, Adams constitutes meaning
in the very struggle to find a place in a bewildering
modern world" (129).  <fpage>129</fpage>

"Grant fretted and irritated him, like the Tere-

right to exist. He should have been extinct for ages.
The idea that, as society grew older, it grew one-sided,

progress of evolution from President Washington to

Darwin" (266).  <fpage>266</fpage>

Adams as a "man of interpreta-

design participates in modern man's continuing faith in
design, in careful planning and concerted devotion as
means of assuring success; the man of interpretation
participates, on the other hand, in modern man's
tendency, especially in art, to make interpretation—
both as historical recounting (historical narrative) and
as imaginative translation (artistic narrative)—a means
of taming unexpected and unacceptable failure" (6).  <fpage>6</fpage>
