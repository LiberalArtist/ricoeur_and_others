         <abstract>
            <p>To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's<italic>Moby-Dick</italic>shows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading of<italic>Moby-Dick</italic>. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.</p>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">In 1941, Matthiessen set the official interpretation of Ahab as corresponding to what Ishmael makes of his captain, announcing that the “monomaniacal master” is chained to his fate, “becom[ing] ever more excessive as he advances, both chasing and being chased to his deadly end” (<fpage>449</fpage>). Like most of the studies focusing on the figure, Matthiessen's assessment of Ahab derives from the narrator's. The critical assessment of Ahab as a madman, whose folly stems from a preoccupation that “eats out his own heart,” and the reliance upon Ishmael for textual direction has continued to dominate criticism on<italic>Moby-Dick</italic>to the present day.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Melville plays with reader identification in a similar manner in<italic>The Confidence-Man</italic>, in which he explicitly critiques the act of placing confidence in narration; there is no reason not to assume he is making a similar, if less explicit, move in<italic>Moby-Dick</italic>. Indeed, the author of this story may not hold the same viewpoint on anything transpiring in this book that his mouthpiece does; if<italic>The Confidence-Man</italic>, teaches us anything, it is that one can have no trust—in authors, characters, or narratives.

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">In two studies, Ahab figures as the center of an epistemology different from Ishmael's. Dillingham argues that Ahab's gnosticism separates him from everyone else involved in the text (passim). Larson's study, methodologically closer to this essay, locates Ahab as a meditation on analogical linguistic structures.<person-group person-group-type="author">
                  <string-name>Larson</string-name>
               </person-group>argues that for the captain there “is no ‘outside’ to metaphor”:<article-title>“Ahab fails to signify Ahab so much as rhetoric”</article-title>(<fpage>25</fpage>). Or, as<person-group person-group-type="author">
                  <string-name>Paul Ricoeur</string-name>
               </person-group>would state,<article-title>“no non-metaphorical standpoint [exists] from which [he might] look upon metaphor.”</article-title>(<fpage>18</fpage>). According to Larson, Ahab sees no difference between the figural and the literal, and the critic is correct in his observations up until the point where he claims Ahab seeks to escape materiality, deny his body, and become “what the whale represents”— that “invisible referent behind all of ‘harlot’ nature” (<fpage>27</fpage>). Larson critiques Ahab from a poststructuralist position that ignores the pre-Derridean, pre-Saussurean phenomenological attributes of Ahab and his language (and Melville's language as well). Larson presents an Ahab<italic>wishing</italic>“for the prelapsarian” in comparison to the “healthy” (more recognizably modern) Ishmael, who can make the “distinction between the figural and proper, between metaphor and body” (<fpage>25</fpage>). Ahab does deny a difference between the literal and the figural, but he does not wish to move beyond the material: language as material is power for Ahab, and Ahab, if anything, enjoys power. On historicizing the metaphysics of presence as it relates to literature, see<person-group person-group-type="author">

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ultimately, Ishmael can be viewed as working to the same effect. After all, the figure of the narrator materially manifests the process of interpretation—Ishmael performs interpretation. Yet it takes much more to make apparent the invisible blinders of interpretation in this text, as this essay will show.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">This phrase raises the specter of post-structuralism, difference, and the notion that indeed “Nothing exists in itself.” The concept of linguistic difference may be the greatest theoretical challenge to Melville's physically-based way of knowing (the process will be outlined by this essay as a logic of trophyism), for if signifier and signified exist only in relation to other signifiers and signifies, and the relationship between signifier and signified is arbitrary, then the notion of the invested literary object is in trouble. Yet, in effect, certain literary objects have more significance than others, and even if, as the deconstructionists argue, everything is text, that does not mean that all signified corresponding to signifiers signify equally. In other words, even if everything is text and everything is metaphorical, some texts will always carry more weight than others. Derrida has shown that presence and immediacy are derived (there are only differences), but we need to remember that Melville pre-dated post-Heideggerian theory and to historicize current critical perspectives if we are to open ourselves to Melville's other epistemologies (see note 3 above). To dismiss Melville's other than interpretive ways of knowing and all that he uncovers through them because modern critical inquiry privileges theories based on absence not presence throws the baby out with the bathwater, and what a baby it is.<person-group person-group-type="author">

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">I realize I'm playing fast and loose with such terms as trophies and cannibalism, but that is because I am following Melville's text, which most certainly does: for instance, the Marquesans were cannibals and ate the bodies of their dead enemies, but they did not (as Tommo discovers) preserve the heads of their victims in the manner of the Dyaks of Borneo.<person-group person-group-type="author">

Moreover, the blending of whaling, cannibalism, headhunters, and such, is not without precedent. In his own sea voyages, Melville could not avoid running into tales of head hunting and anthropophagy; it was occurring or had occurred within short distances of almost every port where he stopped during his expeditions.

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ishmael completely misreads the captain: he sees Ahab as a tragic, melancholic figure suffering from a woe that can only be a form of madness. Projected onto Ahab, this assumed woe is a negative, self-destructive thing. Ahab, however, is not a living, realistic person, but a textual figure; Ishmael, the “realistic” narrator (himself a textual figure), cannot help but attempt to interpret and, inevitably, misread him. Simply put, the two textual figures function differently. Understandably, since the reader supposedly sees the expedition through Ishmael's eyes, he or she may misread Ahab and his quest.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">An analogy can be made between a world of “real” objects and a world of signifiers, both with their corresponding spirit worlds, but we cannot simply read Ahab as an exemplar of the Saussurian linguistic sign and still appreciate his construction as the center of an alternate epistemology. Viewed from a phenomenologically-minded perspective, Ahab defies poststructuralist linguistic analysis, as ultimately all “meaty” literature does. In the act of such dissecting, physical rhetoric invariably seems to die, leaving the critic with lifeless prose and a lot of explaining to do.</mixed-citation>

We must remember that Ahab is only a textual figure and the logic of his existence is a textual logic, lest like Ishmael, we judge too soon and doom Ahab's entire existence, not just his textual demise, to the tragic abyss.</mixed-citation>

                  <string-name>Simpson</string-name>

I argue the obverse: Ahab especially rejoices in the rhetorical trophies he produces (and in language so many critics love to quote).
