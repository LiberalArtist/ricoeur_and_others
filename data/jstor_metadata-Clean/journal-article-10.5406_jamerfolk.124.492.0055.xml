         <abstract>
            <p>Culture apprentices the body to its style. Gestures are the visible and kinaesthetic trace of that apprenticeship. They are specific to bodies, families, age grades, ethnic groups, social orders, and historical moments. They are folklore. The gestures I consider here are affiliated with talk. They conjure up in the gesture space in front of the body the iconic and metaphoric objects that talk mentions. In a gesture, Maurice Merleau-Ponty writes, "the intentional object is offered to the spectator at the same time as the gesture itself” ([1962] 1995:186). The gesturer's intentionality colonizes the spectator's, making it intersubjective: phenomenology's foundational perspective.</p>

Even in<italic>The Phenomenology of Perception</italic>([1962] 1995), Merleau-Ponty does not often use the term “intersubjectivity,” and for good reason. It imports back into the enmeshment of two bodies a disembodied mentality, as if interactants were telepathically connected. I, too, prefer his later term.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Thank Harry Berger for his skepticism. It obliged me to work out the difference between perceiving somebody making a gesture toward an object and perceiving somebody making an iconic (or metaphoric) gesture that entailed its object. The puzzlement of one of the outside readers with the way I originally wrote this sentence obliged me to clarify it in the next one. I appreciate that reader's close attention to the argument.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">This single remark by Merleau-Ponty anchors the intersection I explore here between gestures and phenomenology. He mentions gestures only a couple of times in<italic>The Phenomenology of Perception</italic>, and he would not have had in mind affiliative gestures like iconics, let alone metaphorics, which George Lakoff did not think of until the 1980s (<person-group person-group-type="author">

               <year>1992</year>:<fpage>x</fpage>). Possibly Merleau-Ponty had in mind only the sort of anticipatory gesture he describes on pages 138–9. But he understood the gesture as more than either itself or its object. My project here is to specify what more there is to be understood.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Contrast Merleau-Ponty's account of my perception of the other with Harris Berger and Giovanna del Negro's description of Husserlian<italic>apperception</italic>: When I see the body of another person, I have what Husserl calls an “analogical apperception”—an experience of that other body not merely as an object but as another<italic>subject, another entity who has experience …</italic>Apperception occurs in any experience of things as examples of a type, but the apperception of other subjects is unique. The type “subject” emerges from the most primordial level of our experience—the sphere of own-ness … [so that] your body and mine are inherently “paired” in experience. One implication of this idea is that the concept “subject” establishes the apperception of both “self ” and “other,” that the subject is not radically my own but inherently social. (<year>2004</year>:<fpage>98</fpage>) This is the trace of idealism in Husserlian phenomenology: the idea of the thing precedes perception of the thing itself. Merleau-Ponty's point is that the perception in question is not merely analogical but deeply experiential.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Iacoboni does not distinguish between the intention to imitate, which is a matter of representational intentionality, and the involuntary imitation of mirror neurons, which is a matter of motor intentionality. He takes imitation as the broad category of which mirror neuron responses are a narrower part. Surely it is the other way around. Mirroring, the involuntary kind of imitation, in which the body of the perceiver is taken over by the act of the other without the perceiver's volition, is primary. Both bodies simply participate in intercorporeity. Imitating somebody else on purpose builds on a prior capacity to mirror that person unintentionally. As Vittorio Gallese suggests, “If I want to reproduce the behavior of someone else, no matter how complex it is, or whether I understand it or not, I always need to translate my external perspective of the demonstrator into my own personal bodily perspective” (<year>2003</year>:<fpage>519</fpage>). Representational intentionality is a specialization of motor intentionality, not the reverse.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Iacoboni points out that persons considered empathetic by other criteria mimic the postures, movements, and facial expressions of their interactants unconsciously (<year>2005</year>:<fpage>95</fpage>). Paul Ekman's work on how the imitation of face postures that are emotion expressions evokes the emotions the postures are expressions of, even if the imitators do not know what expression their faces are being manipulated into, supports this possibility (<year>1992</year>:<fpage>390</fpage>–<lpage>1</lpage>). Ray Birdwhistell's work on<italic>interactional synchrony</italic>suggests that this mimicry may be mutual (1973). By extension, a clever practitioner can deliberately mimic the other's movement, get into synchrony, and induce her interactant to imitate hers, thereby choreographing a shared disposition under one participant's conscious control. This possibility constitutes a form of hypnosis.</mixed-citation>

I doubt it. My suspicion is that the point of the mirror neuronal response is not to differentiate myself from the other but to coparticipate in being in the world.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Berger takes Husserl to be the philosopher who broke with the idealism that held philosophy in thrall for two thousand years. “Husserl developed his work in reaction to an idealist philosophy that set up a sharp (and to some, commonsensical) contrast between experience and objective reality. According to that idealism, we are never in contact with the objective world of things; we have only experience, and this is completely distinct from objective reality” (<year>1999</year>:<fpage>19</fpage>–<lpage>20</lpage>). In my view, and in Hubert Dreyfus's, the break does not come until Heidegger (<person-group person-group-type="author">
                  <string-name>Dreyfus</string-name>
               </person-group>
               <year>2002</year>). Like the idealists, Husserl privileges experience, which brackets the ontological status of the objects experienced via what he calls the<italic>epoché</italic>: we must place an<italic>epoché</italic>(set of brackets) around any claims that a particular experience is subjective or objective and investigate the data of experience in an unprejudiced manner. When we return to experience in this way, Husserl suggests, we make a startling discovery: nothing has changed. Strictly as lived experience, the desk before me, for example, is a genuine other, an autonomous entity in no way subject to my whims. As a result, we never need to remove the phenomenological brackets. (<person-group person-group-type="author">
                  <string-name>Berger</string-name>
               </person-group>and<person-group person-group-type="author">

               </person-group>
               <year>2004</year>:<fpage>97</fpage>) Maybe not, but by the same token, we never have access to the real, and here I am taken with Berger's own telling description of this sort of consciousness “as some metaphysical substance that must be poured onto an object for it to be able to enter into experience” (<year>1999</year>:<fpage>303</fpage>footnote). Like me, Berger recognizes a distinction between Husserl and Merleau-Ponty. Husserl's phenomenology is a transcendental phenomenology in that it emphasizes that the world exists as something there to be constituted in experience; in that sense the world is constituted within experience. The existential phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty differs from Husserl's in many ways, but on this fundamental level the difference is merely one of emphasis: Merleau-Ponty agrees that the world is there for experience, but he emphasizes that the subject is there in that world, as much constituted by it as he or she constitutes it. (<year>1999</year>:<fpage>20</fpage>) For me, this difference cuts deeper. Merleau-Ponty, heir to both Husserl and Heidegger, discovers both the enmeshment of the body with things and the disappearance of things from (conscious) experience in intercorporeity.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Following Husserl, Berger and del Negro describe anticipation rather more literally than Merleau-Ponty intends it, as the expectation of an actual future. I directly experience the surfaces that face me; I don't, of course, experience the details of its back … but I am aware that the back is there and would be available for future viewing … [A]s I look at the front, I experience the fact that it has a back that could be the object of my future experiences…. In Husserl's terminology, the back … is “presentiated” to me. Two important ideas stem from this analysis. First of all, the fact that the physical world admits other perspectives is important because it shows that the physical world is an intersubjective world…. [F]eatures that are beyond my immediate grasp … may become the focus of future experiences—for myself at some other point in time or for others situated at a different location in the same space…. In the same way that my experience of the front face of the desk presentiates the existence of the back of the desk, so does the body of the other presentiate a realm of particular experiences to which I do not have direct access but that I know with certainty is there. (<year>2004</year>:<fpage>98</fpage>–<lpage>9</lpage>) According to Merleau-Ponty, as Dreyfus insists (2002), the other sides of things are part of my perceptual experience in the present. Nor do I grant the existence of a physical world beyond my subjective perception because other people can see it even when I do not. Quite the reverse. It is only when I notice that other people can see things I do not that I come up with the notion of separate subjects. Up to that developmental moment, we inhabit the same intercorporeal world.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Husserl conflated two modalities of being, which Heidegger correctly, in Merleau-Ponty's view (and mine), separated out. Or, to put it the other way, Heidegger refined a concept already implicit in Husserl's phenomenology. The perceptibility of the anticipated but occluded side of objects along with the presented side is not subjectivity but intersubjectivity or, more correctly, intercorporeity. This perspective is not thinkable or reflect-on-able but enactable. As the other outside reader notes, one's acts anticip-ate something<italic>but not consciously</italic>. The anticipation appears as motor intentionality. What is thinkable and what one thinks about when one thinks about it is that only the front sides of things could possibly be perceptible. This is representational intentionality and demonstrates what happens when we try to pull motor intentionality into consciousness. This conscious reflective moment is subjectivity, and it is different from the corporeal capacity to act toward the properties of an object I perceive but do not see.</mixed-citation>

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">Though he, too, sees meaning as the key concern of folkloristics, Berger returns meaning to the perspectival, which is to say, to the subjective. What is primary for human research is the lived reality of meanings, not some ideally rich universe of cultural objects, and this visual/physical metaphor is particularly apt for explaining the point. The everyday world of lived social experience is always perspectival. Some meanings stand out sharply illuminated, others wallow in the shadows, vague and colorless. More important, the relationship between sharply articulated and intense meanings and dimly perceived, marginal meanings provides experience with a texture—a depth and quality—that is just as important as any individual meaning present. Such “textures” come about as a peculiar effect of the foreground/background structure of experience. Again the metaphor is visual. (<year>1999</year>:<fpage>123</fpage>) Merleau-Ponty's undertaking, which I take up here, is to move meaning out of the subjective into the intercorporeal.</mixed-citation>
