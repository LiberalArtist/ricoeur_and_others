Here, I will refer to papers from the Miller Archives as the “Miller Papers,” hereafter cited in text as MP, followed by box and folder number.

            <mixed-citation publication-type="other">As McGandy underscores, functioning objects do not merely represent actions or environments, nor are they just signs indicative of content or independent states of be-ing. McGandy provides a thorough examination of the context of symbolic functioning, as well as a close comparison of signs and symbols (<italic>Active Life</italic>chap. 3). Tyman explains the symbolic character of functioning objects insofar as “all significance is mediated through them” (<italic>Descrying the Ideal</italic>
               <fpage>104</fpage>). Colapietro's discussion of symbolic action runs throughout his monograph on Miller (<italic>Fateful Shapes</italic>). His handling of the way the body functions as a symbol occurs in Chapter 3.</mixed-citation>

The center of this obscurantism is the repudiation of the act” (MS 13).

            <mixed-citation publication-type="book">In the following, I will argue that Miller's reception of Kant links him to more familiar late modern initiatives. While a point-by-point survey of these continuities is beyond the scope of this essay, one representative comparison would juxtapose Miller's midworld of functioning objects to Gilles Deleuze's exploration of the “virtual,” and likewise to the “sensible deformations” of form. Deleuze often depicts the sensible appearance outside of which no form can be given; see, for example,<person-group person-group-type="author">

Compare this to Miller's claim that “we are in league with meanings in ourselves that our own experience has not produced. We do not, therefore, know what our words mean unless we search out those experiences of others by which they have come to mean what they now mean to us” (PH 187).</mixed-citation>

In this essay, I am focusing on Miller's appropriation and transformation of the Kantian “constitutive” (and regulative), so this distinction is not essential to my argument, though it is consistent with it.</mixed-citation>
