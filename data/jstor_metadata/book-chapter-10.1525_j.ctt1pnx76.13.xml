      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,<italic>Carnal Thoughts</italic>shows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.<italic>Carnal Thoughts</italic>provides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.</p>

                     <p>This is, perhaps, an “undisciplined” book, informed as it is by my multidisciplinary grounding and interests in film and media studies, cultural studies, and—an oddity in the United States—existential philosophy. Nonetheless, however undisciplined, the essays brought together in<italic>Carnal Thoughts</italic>are not unruly. Indeed, whatever their specific subject matter and inflection, they share a single overarching theme and emerge from a single—albeit quite open—method.</p>
                     <p>The major theme of<italic>Carnal Thoughts</italic>is the embodied and radically material nature of human existence and thus the lived body’s essential implication in making “meaning” out of bodily “sense.” Making conscious</p>

How does it feel and what does it look like to age and grow old in our youth-oriented and image-conscious culture—particularly if one is a woman? In an article on the cultural implications of changing age demographics as a consequence of what has been called “the graying of America,” James Atlas writes:</p>

                     <p>Nearly every time I read a movie review in a newspaper or popular magazine, I am struck by the gap that exists between our actual<italic>experience</italic>of the cinema and the<italic>theory</italic>that we academic film scholars construct to explain it—or perhaps, more aptly, to explain it away. Take, for example, several descriptions in the popular press of Jane Campion’s<italic>The Piano</italic>(1993): “What impresses most is the tactile force of the images. The salt air can almost be tasted, the wind’s furious bite felt.”¹ The film is “[a]n unremittingly sensuous experience of music and fabric, of mud and</p>

                     <p>This chapter is about the existential possibilities and contradictions that mark our “gaze” at the world and others—and, more particularly, about these possibilities and contradictions as they have been materially embodied and dramatized in the cinematic vision of the great Polish director, Krzysztof Kieslowski. But this chapter is also about something more—namely, the ambiguous nature of the empirically concrete happenstance to which we, as objective and sensible beings, are always subject. As we—and our gazes—are materially embodied in the space-time of the world with other objective beings and things, we are engaged in incalculable encounters whose</p>

                     <p>The following phenomenological meditations on the carnal activity of writing were provoked by an electronic doll. A contemporary version of eighteenth-century anthropomorphic writing automata, “Susie Scribbles” appeared on the shelves of Toys R Us quite a number of Christmases ago and sold for $119. Unable to resist, I bought her. Susie and the peculiarities of her existence raised significant questions about writing bodies and writing technologies—not only because her automaton’s instrumentalism interrogated what writing is and how it is accomplished but also because the form in which this instrumentalism was embodied interrogated what is—or is not—“human” about</p>

Elaine Scarry writes that “we make things so that they will in turn remake us, revising the interior of embodied consciousness.”¹ Certainly, those particularly expressive technologies that are entailed in the practices of writing and the fine arts do, indeed, “remake” us as we use them—but how much more powerful a revision of our embodied consciousness occurs with the inauguration of perceptive technologies such</p>

G. Ballard, first published in 1973, with a significant author’s introduction added in 1974 that was carried forward in subsequent editions.³ My anger at Baudrillard arose from what seemed his willful misreading of a work</p>

Indeed, there seems to be an inverse ratio between<italic>seeing</italic>our bodies and<italic>feeling</italic>them: the more aware we are of ourselves as the cultural artifacts, symbolic fragments, and made things that we see in—and as—images, the less we seem to sense the intentional complexity and richness of the corporeal existence that substantiates them.

                     <p>Always concerned with the subversive capacity of cinema to show us what we may not wish to see, critic Amos Vogel has frequently commented on the medium’s tendency to avert its eyes before the sight of actual death. He writes: “Now that sex is available to us in hard-core porno films, death remains the one last taboo in cinema. However ubiquitous death is—we all ultimately suffer from it—it calls into question the social order and its value systems; it attacks our mad scramble for power, our simplistic rationalism and our unacknowledged, child-like belief in immortality.”¹ Death, Vogel suggests,</p>

                     <p>The integration of documentary footage into fiction films often causes something of a stir in the popular press. Although the practice dates back to the very beginnings of cinema, what has attracted current attention to it and raised the issue of media ethics is the particular manner in which new digital technologies have transformed this practice by supposedly making such integration so seamless as to undermine the public’s ability to differentiate fact from fiction, the real from the imaginary or “irreal.”¹ Thus, the media hype: first around the digital wonders of<italic>Forrest Gump</italic>(Robert Zemeckis, 1994), which inserted its eponymous</p>

                     <p>Central to any understanding of the connection between ethics and aesthetics, the question of “the limit between the body and the world” is a question posed not only by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in<italic>The Visible and the Invisible</italic>¹ but also—and most vividly—by his less sanguine colleague, Jean-Paul Sartre, in his novel<italic>Nausea</italic>.² Whether put in terms that suggest existential ease or horror, awesome or awful encounters with inanimate “things,” inherence in the world or alienation from it, this question interrogates the<italic>objectivity</italic>of subjectively embodied and sensate being and how it is both like and unlike the sensible being</p>
