         <p>An interdisciplinary collection for scholars and students interested in the connections between myth and scripture</p>
         <p>In this collection scholars suggest that using "myth" creates a framework within which to set biblical writings in both cultural and literary comparative contexts. Reading biblical accounts alongside the religious narratives of other ancient civilizations reveals what is commonplace and shared among them. The fruit of such work widens and enriches our understanding of the nature and character of biblical texts, and the results provide fresh evidence for how biblical writings became "scripture."</p>
         <p>Features:</p>
         <p>Essays that explore how myth sheds light on the emergence of scriptureExamples drawn from the Ancient Near East, Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Greco-Roman worldArticles by experts from a range of disciplines</p>

                     <p>This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.</p>

                     <p>The terms<italic>myth</italic>and<italic>Scripture</italic>have often been galvanizing terms when applied to the Bible. In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support. This has been most clearly articulated in Robert Oden’s<italic>The Bible without Theology</italic>, subtitled<italic>The Theological Tradition and Alternatives to It</italic>, in which Oden eschews questions of theology in his treatment of myth, in support of what he refers to as “the process by which biblical study is moving</p>

                     <p>However one chooses to define myth—and as this volume demonstrates, there exists more than one viable option—it is an intrinsically comparative concept, designating as it does a broad class of cross-cultural phenomena. Consider, for example, Georges Dumézil, that great Indo-European mythologist, who made of comparison a type of fundamental intellectual principle: “On ne définit très bien les choses que par comparaison avec autre chose.”¹ To employ the concept of myth in biblical studies, then, is to situate some aspect of biblical literature in relation to “the mythical.” These comparisons may be conceptualized concretely in terms of more or</p>

                     <p>Is Gen 1 a myth? The answer to this question depends on what one thinks a myth is and also on what one think about Gen 1. For believers in the Bible, the answer is, of course not. For many readers of the Bible, the idea of biblical stories as myths became a critical issue because of the discovery of tablets with stories from ancient Mesopotamia. For centuries, the Bible was considered the word of God, but texts emerging from excavations in Mesopotamia challenged the idea of the Bible as unique. When the Bible was studied in the context of</p>

Luzzato: “Moses our Teacher committed one sin, but the exegetes have loaded upon him thirteen sins and more, since each of them has invented a new sin” (Propp 1988, 19). Luzzato’s quote here refers to the many scholarly attempts to interpret Num 20:1–13, the story in which Moses, with Aaron at his side, draws water from a rock to provide drink for the thirsting Israelites, yet brings forth that water in such</p>

                     <p>In this paper I will assess the strengths, weaknesses, and implications of the use of early Hebrew poems as a control group for the testing of single theories and methodological paradigms aimed at the reconstruction of myth, folklore, and social reality in ancient Israel. Here I build on the work done within the Albright-Cross-Freedman tradition on Gen 49; Exod 15; Num 23–24; Deut 32, 33; Judg 5; 1 Sam 2; 2 Sam 1, 22, 23; and Pss 18, 29, 68, 72, and 78 (see, e.g., Cross and Freedman 1952, 1997; Geller 1979; Cross 1973; Freedman 1980).

                     <p>Scholars generally recognize the importance of Ezekiel’s oracles concerning the downfall of Tyre in 26:1–28:19 among the oracles concerning the nations in Ezek 25–32. Like the oracles concerning Egypt in Ezek 29–32, the oracles concerning Tyre constitute an inordinately large block of material when compared to the smaller oracles concerning Ammon in 25:1–7, Moab in 25:8–11, Edom in 25:12–14, Philistia in 25:15–17, Sidon in 28:20–23, and even Israel/Jacob in 28:24–26. The importance of Ezekiel’s Tyrian oracles is generally assessed in relation to Nebuchadnezzar’s alleged thirteen-year siege of the city, which ultimately</p>

                     <p>Without question, 2 Corinthians is the hardest of Paul’s letters to read and understand. This is partly due to the complex character of its composition: even if we do not accept its segmentation into several fragments,¹ the<italic>logos</italic>rhetoric, especially in its arrangement, remains opaque.² Paul’s extraordinarily dense language intertwines the specific circumstances of Paul and his readers with the work of God in Christ.

On the other hand, we struggle to understand precisely how the term was used in ancient literature, and all too often apply modern definitions to the ancient term.</p>

                     <p>One of the most notorious aspects of ancient Greek myth was its frequent depiction of the gods as engaging in conduct that is morally problematic. The scandalous manner in which various myths portrayed the gods was doubtless one of the factors that made them popular in many social circles, but these same immoral depictions raised a number of serious intellectual and ethical questions that were debated at length throughout antiquity. The fundamental question was whether these common depictions of the gods were true. If so, the gods were often exemplars of vice rather than of virtue, and human morality was</p>

                     <p>The study of hero myths goes back at least to 1871, when the Victorian anthropologist E. B. Tylor argued that many of them follow a uniform plot: the hero is exposed at birth, is saved by other humans or animals, and grows up to become a national hero (see Tylor 1871, 1:254–55).¹ In 1876 the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn used fourteen cases to argue that all “Aryan” hero tales follow an “exposure and return” formula more comprehensive than Tylor’s (see von Hahn 1876, 340). In each case the hero is born illegitimately, out of the fear of</p>

                     <p>Fans of Robert Segal will find him in classic form here, working the permutations and combinations of both mythical narratives and theorists that he has applied to them. Novel here is Segal’s claim that the biblical narrative accounts of the life of King Saul conform to mythical patterns. Closely examined, that is, they show themselves exemplifying classic mythical themes such as the son’s desire to kill the father. As interpreted by two major classical theorists, psychoanalyst Otto Rank, and myth-ritualist Lord Raglan, Segal works over the biblical text to show how the perspectives of both Rank and Raglan can be</p>

                     <p>Professor Segal’s paper, “The Life of King Saul as Myth,” was originally embedded in a longer presentation entitled “The Indispensability of Theories of Myth for Biblical Studies.” It was given to a joint session of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature at their annual meetings in 2009. Professor Segal had attempted to demonstrate his thesis about the indispensability of theories of myth for biblical studies by giving a reading of the Saul narratives in the Hebrew Bible, which was informed by the hero theories of myth in the work of Otto Rank, Lord Raglan, Joseph</p>

                     <p>I thank Ivan Strenski, Adela Yarbro Collins, and David Miller for their exceedingly incisive comments on my paper. The version of the paper that I gave at the SBL session in San Diego in 2007 was much longer than the present version. Occasionally, the respondents discuss issues that for lack of space had to be dropped from the published version.</p>
                     <p>In reply to Strenski, I do not assert that theories, to qualify as theories, must answer all three main questions about myth: those of origin, function, and referent. For me, Bultmann, Jonas, and Camus are still theorists even though they</p>
