         <p>This book arrives on foot of a decade of commemorations. Contemporary Ireland was founded during the fractious years of 1912-1923. This volume features essays by leading historians, journalists, civic activists and folklorists. The outstanding body of scholarship offers a complexity of new views in the debate how to commemorate a divided past.</p>

                     <p>The years between 1912 and 1923 were arguably the most transformative in modern Irish history. Beginning with the mass signing of the Ulster Covenant and ending with a bloody civil conflict in the nascent Free State, this long decade of war, revolution and rapid social change gave birth to contemporary Ireland, North and South. Many of us hold different, even conflicting, views on the real significance of this violent but fascinating period, and we are unlikely to reach a consensus on episodes as contentious as the Easter Rising, the Battle of the Somme or the War of Independence. We can</p>

                     <p>Both Irish and European politics were riven with conflict between 1911 and 1914. For all the difference of scale between them, they were connected both by the nature of the tensions involved and also by the potential impact of the Irish crisis on the United Kingdom as one of the leading great powers. At the international level there were wars between Italy and the Ottoman Empire in 1911 and 1912, and two wars in the Balkans in 1912 and 1913. In addition, the great powers consolidated their alliances, gave increasing weight to narrowly defined conceptions of military security, and embarked</p>

                     <p>George Dangerfieldâ€™s<italic>The strange death of Liberal England</italic>(1935) is a conundrum. All the senior historians of either Labour or Liberalismâ€”scholars like Henry Pelling, Ross McKibben or Roy Douglasâ€”refute his thesis that the Liberal Party received a decisive destructive blow before 1914. If we shift the argument and say that Dangerfield was merely talking about a liberal<italic>mentalitÃ©</italic>, this hardly helps. The liberal<italic>mentalitÃ©</italic>is still strong in England, and is to be found in all the major parties, which, of course, includes the Liberal Democrats.</p>
                     <p>Yet, in one respect, Dangerfield has received wide historiographical support. This lies</p>

Here, on 2 November 1914, his great-grandfather, James â€˜Jimmyâ€™ Moyles, aged forty, was shot dead whilst serving with the Connaught Rangers. A tragically familiar story, he was one of the more than fifty-eight thousand British casualties of the First Battle of Ypres (Octoberâ€“November 1914).

                     <p>By exploring the question of what republicanism meant to the rebels of 1916, before the Rising became burdened by the weight of its own myth, this chapter seeks to identify some connections between the history of an event and its commemoration. It emphasises how unpredictable the Risingâ€™s success in creating popular support for republicanism was, and argues that this contingent outcome was largely a product of its wartime context. Although the Rising is now synonymous with republicanism, its ideological significance was less apparent at the time: many rebels fought for Irish freedom rather than a republic. The implications of this</p>

                     <p>What happens if we enlarge the time frame of the Great War? European and world politics were militarised well before the war. In both Ireland and the Balkans, the violence that fed directly into the war started in 1912â€“13, as William Mulligan has shown in chapter 1. Continued militarisation of politics and far worse violence prolonged the fighting beyond 1918. In fact, the Great War was the epicentre of a larger cycle of conflict that did not finish until 1923, with the end of the war between Greece and Turkey, the resolution of the crisis over German reparationsâ€”which</p>

                     <p>When I was growing up in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, your religion defined your identity and there was one common question: â€˜Are you one of us or one of them?â€™ This was shorthand for â€˜Are you a Catholic or a Protestant?â€™ In truth, I belonged neither to â€˜usâ€™ nor â€˜themâ€™. My father, an Ulster Presbyterian, had met my mother, a Leinster Catholic, when she nursed in Belfast in the early 1950s. Such is the power of love that, much to the dismay and anger of his parents, my father turned his back on the religion of his birth. He</p>

Life as a political activist has posed many challenges, with many twists and turns, and it has often been uncomfortable. If there is one thread that holds this experience together, it is my political aspiration for a thirty-two-county united and independent Ireland. I cannot tell you when this aspiration entered my consciousness, yet it has always been there in my living memory, and it is probably fair to say that my own aspirations and political experience are reflective of the journey of the Northern nationalist</p>

An estimated twenty thousand soldiers lost their lives that day. Among them was Private Michael Leahy of the Royal Irish Regiment. From Caherconlish in east Limerick, Leahy was thirty-nine and left a widow, Ellen, of Portlaw, Co. Waterford.Â¹ Four years later, his nephew, nineteen-year-old Thomas Leahy, also from Caherconlish, would die while serving with the new Irish National Army.

                     <p>The First World War has been, and is, â€˜rememberedâ€™ and commemorated in Ireland in an extraordinary range of ways. Over recent years, moreover, the intensity of this commemoration appears to have increased, as the events themselves have receded. This is especially true in independent Ireland, where commemoration has ebbed and flowed since the end of the war itself, but where now engagement with the war and its commemoration has become especially striking and prevalent. And over the coming years, during which the centenary of the First World War will be marked, this trend is likely to be further intensified. It</p>

                     <p>History and commemoration are not incompatible, but the proper relationship between these two pursuits is contested and uneasy. As participants in the public debates and manifestations associated with the current â€˜decade [<italic>sic</italic>] of commemorationsâ€™, historians should warn planners against the perils of adopting bad history when designing their commemorative programmes. Though many may reject the very concept of â€˜good historyâ€™, few would deny that historical research is capable of identifying elements of falsification, distortion and undue political influence in the way that past events are narrated. Academic historians are not privileged arbiters of historical truth, but they should be better</p>

                     <p>Marion Square is the main public space of the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Within it, a tall, four-sided iron screen contains a sixteen-foot-long bronzed sculpture of an abandoned tallith, a Jewish prayer shawl. Jews also use the tallith as a burial shroud, with one of its four fringes removed as a symbol of death and mourning. The sculpture, erected in 1999, is a subtle and moving memorial to the Holocaust and to survivors of the concentration camps who came to live in the city.</p>

                     <p>The French, no less than the Irish, are obsessed by history. In 1940 Elizabeth Bowen wrote in one of her reports from Ireland to the British Ministry of Information: â€˜I could wish that the English kept history in mind more, that the Irish kept it in mind less.â€™Â¹ Likewise, the French are not known to be suffering from memory lossâ€”quite the contrary. Consequently, there is nothing that the French or the Irish love quite so much as a good commemoration.</p>
                     <p>However, the exercise has its limits. Like the abuse of drink, the abuse of commemoration is fraught with danger.</p>

                     <p>Ireland will not be alone in marking the events that transformed the world a century ago during the decade of the First World War. From a divided Middle East to a reunited Germany, from Poland and the Czech/Slovak Republicsâ€”which first won their modern independence in 1918â€”to a Hungary that still mourns the territory it lost in 1919, the legacy of the â€˜Greater Warâ€™ of 1912â€“23 is written into the geopolitical landscape, just as it is with the partition of Ireland. The legacy is even stronger in the cultural sphere. Rituals that are now commonplace were invented to</p>
