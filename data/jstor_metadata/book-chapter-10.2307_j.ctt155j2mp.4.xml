      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.</p>

                     <p>Why joy—and why now? It is perhaps counterintuitive for joy to occupy a central place in a Christian theology, or at least in a theology capable of taking seriously the state of the world in which we live. Have not the masters of suspicion sufficiently warned theologians away from commending religious sentiments that, in their spiritual purity, distract their subjects from the material situation of life and issue in a total flight from the world? Did not the manifold tragedies of the mid-twentieth century disabuse theologians once and for all of their Pollyanna-ish penchant for progress, their sure confidence</p>

                     <p>Once before I have written a theology of joy. This was in 1971 on the climax of the Vietnam War and the worldwide protest-movement against it. This was in the midst of student rebellions and the liberation movements in the third world. The German title was<italic>Die ersten Freigelassenen der Schöpfung. Versuche über die Freude an der Freiheit und das Wohlgefallen am Spiel</italic>(“The first liberated men in creation: experiments on the joy of freedom and the pleasure of play”)—the English title was<italic>Theology and Joy</italic>.¹</p>

                     <p>In studying the topic of joy in the Scriptures, several methodological challenges immediately present themselves. Perhaps the most pressing of them concerns the proper entry point for such a study. The most direct way into the topic would seem to be through a word or words for “joy.” But which word or words? Should the net be cast broadly to include any and all passages in which one finds the ideas of joy, gladness, blessedness, celebration, and the like, or somewhat more narrowly, focusing perhaps on passages that include particular words?¹ Should we identify key words in the Hebrew or</p>

                     <p>Every year in the church’s calendar we read the story of Jesus’ ascension in Acts 1. But we also remind ourselves of the much shorter version of the same story that Luke has placed at the end of his Gospel (24:50–53). There we find a phrase that has always puzzled me. Jesus, says Luke, was separated from them and carried up into heaven; whereupon they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem “with great joy.” This seems, to put it mildly, counterintuitive. Why would they be so joyful if Jesus has been taken from them? Ought they not to be</p>

                     <p>Christians regularly confess that humanity’s “chief and highest end is to glorify God, and fully to enjoy him forever,” as the Westminster Catechism puts it. But what exactly it is to glorify God, and to enjoy God forever, is a matter of some dispute. In fact, none of us can safely say that we fully understand what those words mean. We are called to a destiny that we can name, but one whose inner energies remain veiled to our eyes, in this dispensation at least.</p>

                     <p>The field of pastoral theology and care has been conceptualized as a form of religious response to human suffering. It is said that our research begins “at the point where human suffering evokes or calls for a religious response and sometimes at the point where a religious response is given and/or experienced.”¹ In light of this widely shared understanding, it is not surprising that, with a few important exceptions,² joy is as understudied in this field as it is in the other theological disciplines represented in this volume.

                     <p>“To¹ miss the joy is to miss all,” wrote Robert Louis Stevenson in his essay “The Lantern-Bearers” (1887).² No matter what we possess or experience and irrespective of how we act, if we miss joy we have missed all.
