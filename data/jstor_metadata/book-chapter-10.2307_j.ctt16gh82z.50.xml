         <p>This landmark collection by an international group of scholars and public intellectuals represents a major reassessment of French colonial culture and how it continues to inform thinking about history, memory, and identity. This reexamination of French colonial culture, provides the basis for a revised understanding of its cultural, political, and social legacy and its lasting impact on postcolonial immigration, the treatment of ethnic minorities, and national identity.</p>

                     <p>The present collection is the fruit of an inquiry that began in the early 1990s and that sought to better elucidate certain aspects of France’s contemporary history. The weight of colonial imaginary, discernible in the production of a colonial iconicity, in colonial cinema, and in the intertextual articulations of images/discourse, called for improved contextualization, as did those mechanisms associated with the construction of different paradigms with respect to the Other in the context of a burgeoning imperialism.¹ Initial research was conducted on the subject of “human zoos,” and then shortly thereafter we began evaluating the importance of colonial expositions and</p>

                     <p>Before getting to the heart of the matter, it is important to clarify the terminology: “antislavery” and “abolitionism” are not equivalent terms, even if there exists admittedly a continuity between the two. Strictly speaking, though one could not be abolitionist without being antislavery, there is a qualitative difference between one term and the other. Proponents of antislavery limited themselves, in a way, to a moral condemnation of slavery based on religious, ethical, and economic principles, but they did not envision a way out, nor the means by which a society founded on slavery might transform itself into one founded on</p>

                     <p>During the twenty-year period between the second abolition of 1848 and the Third republic’s colonial saga, Napoleon III headed France’s imperial policy. History, however, does not recall this period in terms of its great ultramarine<italic>destiny,</italic>or because of its leader’s successful or unsuccessful attempts at conquest. nevertheless, two events stand out as exceptions: the myth of the “Arab Kingdom” and the fiasco that was the Mexican Expedition. From the outset, it might appear that the second empire would not fit into the present topic of analysis, as it is often seen as but a “parenthesis” to French colonial history.</p>

                     <p>During the nineteenth century, the will to make an inventory of all that nature had placed at the disposition of humankind resulted in the invention of “cabinets of curiosity,” collections more exhaustive than they were spectacular. From the outset, they proved essential to the task of describing, comparing, and hierarchizing nature’s elements. Later they would serve to colonize nature, its countries, and its peoples. Indeed, the first colonial conquests (in Egypt, Algeria, India, Australia, etc.) ushered in new fields of study, and reinforced the need for inventory. However, colonial “science” was quickly forced to manage two differing issues, namely that</p>

                     <p>Colonial writing both could have and should have been the ancestor of the current trend of “surprising traveler” novels. However, it is not. Today, colonial literature has been all but forgotten, and even when it is evoked, it is to reaffirm its negative status. In terms of its literary qualities, the genre rarely produced texts rich enough to leave a mark on French literature. Never mind a masterpiece.

                     <p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, theatrical representations of the colonies depicted lands where slavery reigned. The plays were essentially melodramas condemning the cruelty of colonials and their unpitying harshness. After 1848 and the abolition of slavery, the theme quickly grew out of fashion. The West Indies were relegated to the status of “old colonies,” and colonial aspirations were turned instead toward Africa. Outside of the Second Empire’s conquests, Africa was very rarely represented on stage before 1860. However, along with the great travel expeditions, it soon became the kind of exotic locale the bourgeoisie craved to see,</p>

                     <p>On July 14, 1913, during the patriotic High Mass that the Longchamp military parade had become, the president of the Republic, Raymond Poincaré, awarded the Legion of Honor to the first regiment of Senegalese tirailleurs (First RTS ). The act was significant, as this is the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a unit. It recognized the contributions of black soldiers in all colonial operations since 1854, from sub-Saharan Africa to Madagascar up to the most recent campaigns in Morocco. In another gesture of symbolic recognition, which was widely covered in the press, the president presented a French flag</p>

                     <p>In one of his last studies on colonial cinema, Marcel Oms inquires into the question of the genre’s aims and limits.¹ Pertinently, he highlights the near-absence of allusions to military conquest, from Algeria to sub-Saharan Africa to Indochina. Watching these films, one has the impression that these things never even happened, as if France had simply come into possession of these territories naturally. Colonization is presented as being around, as always having been around. Hardly ever does its origin of violence and opposition taint the silver screen. There are only a couple of exceptions: René Clair’s<italic>Les Belles de nuit</italic>

The universal expositions also played a role in the creation of an infrastructure of propaganda, the exclusive concern of which was the colonies. The seedlings of official colonial discourse were first revealed at the Universal Exposition of 1855, with the creation of a</p>

                     <p>The Other is a recurring anthropological figure in every field of social science. On the one hand, because figures of exteriority are the mirrors through which the substance and borders of collective identities are formed, transformed, firmed up, and reaffirmed.¹ The Other is endowed with “characteristics” that vary with the times, but that always fall between two poles: stigmatization and desire. On the other hand, figures of the Other play an invaluable part since they are the motors of all forms of social mobilization and are called upon and instrumentalized to inaugurate or consolidate networks of sociability, to structure or</p>

                     <p>In 1815, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, France found itself with a colorful assortment of colonies: a few islands in the West Indies, Réunion in the Indian Ocean, islands in the Pacific, and two outposts on the coast of Senegal. Throughout the nineteenth century, France positioned itself in order to reconstruct its empire. Competing with Great Britain, it set its sights on the African continent. The relatively early conquest of Algeria (1830) led to a razzia-style war, which in the short term had economically catastrophic results. In contrast, business preceded conquest in sub-Saharan Africa, which, for its part,</p>

                     <p>Black athletes from the French colonies began to appear in metropolitan France in the early twenties.¹ They were represented in the media according to two models: black American champion-athletes, who had become popular in France toward the end of the nineteenth century, and black colonial subjects. The image of the colonial black athlete was elaborated at the intersection of these two imaginaries. However, the progressive stereotyping of these black athletes cannot be reduced exclusively to race. Instead, given the varying contexts in which these stereotypes were produced, their reversible and ever-evolving character, we would do well to consider the different</p>

                     <p>From the early days of the Third Republic until 1931, the perception of overseas territories occupied by soldiers, settlers, and French administrators in metropolitan France was founded on the received idea that these territories and their inhabitants were part of an imperial entity: “Greater France.”¹ This perception resulted from a set of projects highlighting the material benefits the overseas territories brought to the daily lives of the French. If the era of colonization is often presented as the crowning moment of the Republic, it is because of a concerted campaign on its behalf within popular culture, and because public expositions</p>

The context in metropolitan France had been changing over the prior two years.

The French media had a new infatuation, and was preparing the French populace for an event controlled by political parties that also, directly and indirectly, had an influence on major periodicals.

For us, who are accustomed to integrationist discourse, who have been taught to reject racial rhetoric, it seems easy to reject the system of signs—the images, the modes of representation, the discourse—from the colonial Empire. Only those nostalgic for the colonial past—those whom we openly ridicule and stigmatize—persist in using terms from a dated lexicon, in which nostalgia and resentment, regret and rancor come together. However, one would have to be blind to think that colonial discourse had not deeply penetrated French society and culture. As</p>

Indeed, this had been a one-time event designed to spark interest, an interest that subsequently facilitated subtler forms of propaganda. This alternative form of propaganda, deep and sustained, indoctrinated the general public over the long term. After the colonial apogee of the 1930s, the Republic began to promote imperial ideology through its Bureau of Official Propaganda, which drew upon scholarly publications and other</p>

                     <p>The 1930s mark the apogee of the French Empire, and the euphoria accompanying the International Colonial Exposition of 1931 is perhaps the most obvious sign of the public’s obsession with the colonial enterprise. The propaganda generated by the Agence Générale des Colonies gives us a sense of the kind of pro-colonial discourse in circulation, focusing on France’s civilizing mission, as well as the commercial and political greatness bestowed on France by its Empire. However, such ideas can also be found in the editorial pages of newspapers, as well as in pamphlets, films, and books (both fiction and “scientific” works), all</p>

                     <p>Novels, comic strips, movies, an abundance of colonial iconography all testify to the existence of a very specific cultural apparatus that worked to deeply inscribe the “imperial” into metropolitan culture.¹ Moreover, this<italic>imperial culture,</italic>through targeted means of forming and educating the youth, was a major factor in the creation of a “Homo imperialis” in metropolitan France. It did this according to two mechanisms, which have thus far received little scholarly attention. The first concerns the school and the textbooks in which one finds texts and images promoting imperialism. The second is the role played by an extracurricular activity with,</p>

The primary reason for this error is our ignorance of our riches overseas. [ . . . ] Informing an elite interested in self-edification is well and good, however we must also inform the buying masses. This is why publicity for colonial products has become necessary.”¹ Following this logic, propaganda committees were created for</p>

There was now one entity, the French Union, which included both metropolitan France and the overseas territories. The term highlights a desire for solidarity between the two entities and an assumption of egalitarian association. However, today the French union appears as a vain attempt to maintain an already weakened authority. How can we begin to explain this apparent discordance?</p>

                     <p>The 1950s mark a caesura in the manner in which sub-S aharan Africans were perceived in France. After the figure of the “tirailleur as overgrown child” from the interwar years, and before that of the mute and docile “immigrant laborer” from after the independence movements, Africans occupying the center stage in the 1950s were politicians, intellectuals, artists, students, and more. They helped to modify the image of Africans in the French unconscious, even if old stereotypes, born from the paternalism and racism of the colonial era, did not entirely disappear. I will not dwell on this occasion on the intellectual</p>

                     <p>Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed. Another reason for anti-Algerian sentiment was the fact that this labor immigration was organized</p>

                     <p>For all of aesthetic modernism’s self-containment, and for all of colonialism’s faraway-ness, the two activities were twinned. In parallel fashion they rose in the mid-nineteenth century, flourished for about a hundred years, and crashed together in the third quarter of the twentieth. In this chapter, I shall demonstrate that there was indeed—in France, at least—a co-variation between the rise, triumph, and decline of aesthetic modernism and the life cycle of French colonialism. The correlation in timing is not complicated to establish. But then, I wish to argue that the two are reciprocally potentializing. In other words, no French</p>

The expression “politics of<italic>forgetting</italic>”¹ suggests a conscious will to cover up; in the case of colonial history, forgetting appears to be more of a complex and multifaceted process—about which the successive heads of state were fully aware, for it was this forgetting that upheld the myth of the Republic’s “civilizing mission” overseas—than a “plot” or even a “policy.” However, more than fifty years after the defeat at</p>

Far from constituting a rupture, the independence of the vast majority of sub-S aharan French territories to arise with the emergence of the Fifth Republic (including the mandated territories of Togo and Cameroon, which went to France after the First World War), was instead the beginning of a new relationship, a new history between France and the African continent. Officially, this has been referred to as “decolonization,” or a major historical moment of rupture and emancipation that is strongly associated with the France of the imposing General de Gaulle.

The first explorers, adventurers, and traveling scientists as well as the conquerors planting the flags of their nations over faraway lands acquired and returned to Europe with hundreds of thousands of exotic objects.¹ At a later stage, institutions involved in imperialist expansion—government ministries, the army and navy, geographic societies, religious orders—established collections in order systematically to exhibit ethnographic, artistic, and natural specimens from little-known places. These collections were constituted according to widely varying policies and perspectives, depending upon time</p>

                     <p>In these troubled times when the question of memorial laws triggers emotional and polemic responses and when a president of the Republic (in this case Jacques Chirac) reclaimed the term “Civilization,” it seems legitimate to examine the anamnesis of a process that for too long has been buried in our subconscious as a result of amnesty laws and our collective amnesia. This process has its origins in our connection to those colonies that, during two centuries, marked our history, and that are today imprinted on all aspects of French society through the multiple legacies of<italic>colonial culture.</italic>The social relations</p>

                     <p>I am less concerned with untangling the relationship between collective and personal memories, or between memory and history, than with showing once more the reticence on the part of the French academic “ nomenclature” to integrate the colony into discussions, notably, at a time of public debate on the slave trade, slavery, and colonialism. Critical and negative reactions have abounded with respect to what have often been considered poor “ group” manners, namely, the demand to be considered equal among equals. They were asked to be patient, to become civilized, to calmly wait at France’s door for the invitation to</p>

Yet, until recently, the monotheistic<italic>homo religiosus</italic>suffered for and by God. He believed in the redemptive function of suffering.

French military doctrine counts as part of its mission of national defense and the promotion of a “spirit of Defense” within the “collective consciousness.”³ In fact, it operates from the assumption that if the “national body” is to be able to defend itself in case of aggression, it must be mentally healthy, thus perfectly aware of potential</p>

                     <p>In 1962, France withdrew from Algeria back to the French mainland, leaving behind several centuries of colonial history and almost a hundred years of permanent presence on all continents. The army was on the front lines of these events. The whole army. Not just a group of specialized troops. In Algeria, the first units to disembark in 1830 belonged to troops that would later be called “metropolitans.” The state’s will under the Third Republic to associate the nation with conquest explains the decision to send draftees to Madagascar in 1895.

Integrationist rhetoric has functioned as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, finding its justification in its very enunciation. The sociologist Dominique Schnapper, now a member of the Constitutional Council, wrote the following in 1991: “By definition, no matter the national ideology, the nation constructs itself through a process of continuous integration.

A postcolonial methodology considers colonial influences and tropes in literary production, and works to reveal them. Let it first be noted that postcolonialism—in terms of its focus on the colonial influences and tropes in literary production—is already an important domain in the fields of literature and social sciences in Anglophone universities and in other academic institutions all over the world. However, this is not (yet?) the case in France, something that can perhaps be</p>

                     <p>There exists no communication without a representation of the Other, because the Other is never a “reality,” but a virtuality. Admittedly, this virtuality was able to acquire the (illusory) image of a “reality” in the colonial space, because the colonized Other had a status, actually a nonstatus, that was relatively coherent within the dominant colonial stereotype. This means that some people were able to believe in a “real” connection between the image and the figure, making in some way a “being” out of this virtuality, that of the native. In our own postcolonial times, this vision admittedly persists, but not</p>

France had just exited—at last—a cycle of wars that had started in May 1940, and was entering a new era with this ballad from overseas. At the apex of the Empire, then during the wars of decolonization, artists—movie directors, artists, writers, singers—had often linked their</p>

                     <p>Does ethnic tourism lend itself to postcolonial analysis? One must attempt to understand the construction of the gaze on “exoticism” in order to verify the hypothesis of a symbolic inheritance from the colonial era. With this in mind, my analysis relies on the discourse and images found in the brochures of twelve tour operators specializing in the sale of “ethnic” destinations in order to determine which essential arguments these businesses rely upon to capture the attention of future clients. My initial hypothesis is that this discourse and these images answer to the expectations and desires of the clients and therefore</p>
