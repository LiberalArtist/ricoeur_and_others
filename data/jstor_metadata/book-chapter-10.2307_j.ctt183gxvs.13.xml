      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The Spanish word<italic>mestizaje</italic>does not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.<italic>Mestizaje and Globalization</italic>presents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.<italic>Mestizaje and Globalization</italic>contributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.</p>

                     <p>Among their traditional beliefs, Quechua and Aymara peoples of the Andes hold the concept of<italic>pachakuti</italic>, “literally, the turning about of the times … a change of direction” (Delgado-P. 1994, 77), as a turning or reversal of the world (Skar 1994). The Andeans view the pachakuti as a process that does not necessarily take place in a brief span of time but rather builds to a point of climax, of rapid, profound sociocultural change and the emergence of a new world order that has lasting consequences far into the future. Related in Andean Indigenous belief to a world turning or</p>

                     <p>People have been living in the Valley of Mexico for a very long time. The cities of the valley have ranked among the top ten in population in the world since the time of the Roman Empire. Today, Mexico City is one the largest cities in the world. This is a phenomenal comeback because only five hundred years ago the valley suffered catastrophic depopulation as a result of the Spanish Conquest.</p>
                     <p>The decline bottomed out in the mid-1600s, leaving the population base upon which modern Mexico was built: Spaniards who become permanent residents, survivors of African slavery, and the Indigenous</p>

                     <p>Addressing ambivalence in established categories of colonial art in Mexico, this chapter proposes a “mestizo” category to characterize works of visual art elaborated during the Viceroyalty of New Spain, mainly in the sixteenth century. Those works of interest here are devotional paintings, sculptures, and the doors and façades of a number of architectural complexes, which integrate aesthetic and iconographic elements common to Western European art and pre-Columbian art of Mesoamerica. I address the connection between<italic>mestizaje</italic>and culture in art, although mestizaje in Mexico often refers to race.</p>

It was a tradition with Indigenous origins that took place in the context of the religious celebration of Carnaval. This chapter explores the dynamics of cultural and racial<italic>mestizaje</italic>in these isolated regions of the nascent Chilean Republic. It is based on analysis of daily and weekly newspapers from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries published in the town of Vallenar in the Huasco River valley.¹ This period was foundational in the history of the Chilean nation, with the War of the Pacific,</p>

                     <p>The city of Arequipa, Peru’s second largest, has experienced rapid growth due to migration from surrounding rural highland areas. In the past thirty years, Arequipa has seen its population increase by over four hundred thousand inhabitants. Recent population shifts are changing the perception long-time Arequipeños have of their city. Throughout Peru’s republican history, the city has long been represented, from within and without, as a place of diverse racial and ethnic mixing, and it has been characterized as possessing a strong regionalist and unique mestizo culture. Mestizo refers to racial/ethnic/cultural mixing as a category of identity which can refer both</p>

                     <p>Affirmative action policies have existed in Brazil for some time. Between the 1940s and 1980s, Brazilian society tolerated policies of this nature, including a quota system, without major criticism. National legislation promulgated affirmative action policies which extended to the labor market and public universities.¹ From this perspective, there is nothing new in the use of mechanisms that promote equality. However, the situation changed when these policies were specifically extended to the black population. Since its implementation in 2002 in the public universities of Rio de Janeiro state, the system of quotas for black students has been heavily criticized vis-à-vis the</p>

                        <italic>Mestizaje</italic>is a complex and nuanced ideology. Of the notions that the social sciences treat, mestizaje is perhaps one of the more opaque—and loaded. The notion itself encompasses other ideas such as “race,” “culture,” “identity,” and “ethnicity” in fabricating its multiple applications in everyday social, political, and academic settings. These applications overlap each other, producing successive interpretations of what it may be that is being mixed in the mestizaje. These overlapping applications of mestizaje in everyday life all seem to be interwoven with the same thread: the different ways of dealing with diversity.</p>

                     <p>The Cheyenne Sun Dance is a time of personal, community, and earthly renewal. It is a time of harmony and self-sacrifice. Each summer, hundreds of Cheyenne men and women take part in this very sacred and ancient ceremony (fig. 7.1). Families come together and partake in communal living, and for a brief moment, time and space expand beyond the limits of our reality. Ultimately, the Sun Dance is the constant that keeps the Cheyenne tethered to the past, the present, and the future; indeed, the Sun Dance is the door to adaptation and survival.</p>

Through complex and often convergent mechanisms of discourse and urban sociality, indigeneity is today going through a pro cess of redefinition in this part of the Andes, less through the application of criteria of race or language than through the following: participation in cultural per for mances such as music, dance, and private ceremonies; the deployment of new</p>

Given my research experience and my relationships with Ngäbe people, here I examine and understand women’s roles in their relationships with men as they have changed in contexts related to globalization.¹ In 1964, I observed that women seemed to be passive observers of male decision-making in the public arena.

                     <p>The theme of the emergence of ethnicity in Latin America and its crystallization into organized pluriethnic platforms that empower political actors at the national and international levels has been gaining prominence in the social sciences in recent decades. Without doubt spurred by the visibility that Indigenous movements have achieved in settings such as southeastern Mexico, post-war Guatemala, and Ecuador during the Indigenous “uprisings” of the 1990s, and with the ascendency of Evo Morales to the presidency of Bolivia, the research agendas of anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists have focused attention on trying to explain the “resurgence” of the “Indian question.”</p>

What most surprised many Quiteños was not so much Indigenous demands for effective land reform and redress of a series of legal issues, but rather that they<italic>still</italic>existed at all. Despite the fact that some estimates put the Indigenous population as high as three million out of a total population of twelve million, for many Ecuadorians, Indigenous peoples remained invisible or folkloric relics of the past.
