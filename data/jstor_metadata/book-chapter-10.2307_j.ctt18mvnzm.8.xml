         <p>'This beautifully written and lucidly argued study is the most persuasive account of Bourdieu's work yet to be published. Lane illuminates much that can puzzle a foreign readership by expertly situating Bourdieu within a French context. At the same time he points to those aspects of Bourdieu's writing which are of particular relevance to contemporary debates on questions of citizenship and globalization. He gives a fascinating account of Bourdieu's astonishingly prescient analyses of the impact of the expansion of higher education, the influence of the mass media, the growth of the culture industries, and the changing nature of political and social elites, not just in France, but in the western world.'

Below the photograph was a caption which read: ‘Bourdieu, the most powerful intellectual in France’. Inside the magazine, a lengthy ‘dossier’ discussed the perceived strengths and weaknesses of Bourdieu’s work.¹ That same month, similar ‘dossiers’ dedicated to Bourdieu appeared in the other principal French weeklies and dailies,<italic>Le Nouvel observateur, Libération, L’Express</italic>and<italic>Le Monde</italic>.² As the satirical French weekly<italic>Le Canard enchaîné</italic>put it, ‘Bourdieumania’ seemed to have broken out in the</p>

                     <p>The broad details of Pierre Bourdieu’s background and early intellectual career have been well documented, both in existing critical studies and in interviews. He was born in 1930, the son of a postman in a peasant community in the Béarn in the French Pyrenees. Having passed through the<italic>classes préparatoires</italic>at the renowned Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, he entered the elite École normale supérieure to study for an<italic>agrégation</italic>in philosophy, perhaps the most prestigious academic qualification in France at that time. Bourdieu obtained his<italic>agrégation</italic>in 1954 but, frustrated by the abstract tenor of academic philosophy, he abandoned his</p>

                     <p>If Bourdieu’s experiences during the Algerian War had led him to undertake what he had initially considered to be a temporary detour into sociology, by the mid-1960s he had become clearly established as a professional sociologist occupying a position of considerable institutional prestige, surrounded by a team of collaborators. After a year spent as Raymond Aron’s assistant at the Sorbonne, Bourdieu had been appointed as a sociology lecturer at the University of Lille in 1961, working there until 1964. During this period, he became secretary of the Centre de sociologie européenne (CSE), a loose grouping of researchers established by Aron.</p>

                     <p>In the last chapter, we saw that Bourdieu appeared to be embracing a peculiarly French republican vision of the role of formal education in ensuring universal access to knowledge and high culture. Echoing Durkheim’s support at the turn of the century for a secular and ‘rational’ education, Bourdieu’s calls, in<italic>The Love of Art</italic>, for the establishment of a ‘rational pedagogy’ to replace a class-based ‘traditional’ form of education suggested a strong residual faith in the classical ideals of the French republican tradition. However, if this republicanism seemed strangely at odds with the radicalism of Bourdieu’s critique of legitimate culture,</p>

                     <p>In a footnote to<italic>Reproduction</italic>, Bourdieu stated that his ‘theory of pedagogic action’ was ‘grounded in a theory of the relations between objective structures, the habitus and practice’, which would ‘be set out more fully in a forthcoming book’ (1970, p. 9n.1 [p. xiii n.1]). The book in question was published two years later and drew on fieldwork Bourdieu had conducted during the Algerian War. Entitled<italic>Esquisse d’une théorie de la pratique</italic>(1972), it took the form of three anthropological studies of Kabylia followed by a sustained reflection on the political, ethical, and epistemological implications of anthropological study.

Generally referred to as ‘the Berber Spring’, the events of April 1980 were sparked by the decision of the ruling Islamic and Marxist FLN to ban a lecture given by Mouloud Mammeri at the University of Tizi-Ozou to promote a bilingual French-Kabyle collection of poetry,<italic>Poèmes kabyles anciens</italic>(1979).

                     <p>In<italic>Distinction</italic>Bourdieu had been concerned to trace the shift to a more individualistic, cosmopolitan, business-oriented culture in the lifestyles and tastes of France’s bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. This shift in the ‘social field’ as a whole, epitomised by the rise of the ‘progressive fractions’ of France’s bourgeoisie, had also manifested itself in a series of homologous shifts in a range of other fields or sub-fields. Thus, the rise of the ‘new bourgeoisie’ and their allies, the ‘new petty bourgeoisie’, was mirrored in the political field in the rise of ‘reconverted conservatism’ as the new dominant ideology, in the educational</p>

                     <p>Arriving at a final assessment of the value of Bourdieu’s immense and varied output is no easy task. By placing his work in the interrelated contexts of the intellectual field out of which it emerged and the social and cultural changes it has analysed, this study has sought to emphasise the immense perceptiveness with which Bourdieu has traced the dynamic of these changes in postwar France. Indeed, he has often shown considerable prescience, anticipating the future development of socio-cultural phenomena or crystallising a more general or vaguely perceived sense of malaise. This was particularly true of the works on French</p>
