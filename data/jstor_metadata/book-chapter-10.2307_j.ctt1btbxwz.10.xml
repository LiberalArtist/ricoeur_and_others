      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.</p>

                     <p>Memories, identities and heritage have become the new holy trinity for contemporary academic research. In France, this fascination is borne out by a wide variety of sacred texts, be they Pierre Nora’s<italic>Les Lieux de mémoire</italic>(1984–1993) or the more recent<italic>Patrimoine et passions identitaires</italic>, edited by Jacques Le Goff in 1998.¹</p>
                     <p>The purpose of the present volume is to explore the relationship between this surge in academic interest and a demonstrable shift in public consciousness and public passions; the contributors exemplify the many and varied forms that these passions take. Its originality resides in the fact that it</p>

                     <p>For a long time the writing of French history was profoundly influenced by what are now referred to as ‘grand narratives’, which structured our perceptions of the national past. The concern to tell a convincing and coherent story, to make history intelligible and relevant to the present, led historians from a variety of schools and disciplines to focus on the<italic>longue durée</italic>, to seek out the underlying processes of change, often linked to notions of social progress, and to invest history with an inherent and unfolding logic.</p>
                     <p>These narratives have since lost some of their persuasive power. They are now</p>

                     <p>Is it true, as Pierre Nora claimed in 1984, that memory becomes precious just when it vanishes? ‘On ne parle tant de mémoire que parce qu’il n’y en a plus’. What he seems to mean is not that individuals have forgotten their own past, but that collective repositories of memory – such as the French<italic>paysans</italic>– have been destroyed or scattered by devastating and rapid change in recent times. Memory as something magical, often tied to physical objects, rituals or sensations, can be contrasted as it is by Nora, with history, which implies critical reflection: memory is poetry, history</p>

                     <p>The museum is just one element of commemorative public policies and the way war is remembered. In fact, there are many other vehicles for memorialising war besides museums, ranging from social care for war veterans and the management of military cemeteries, to the politics of commemoration (the choice of Remembrance Days, the organisation of commemorative ceremonies) and the erection of physical memorials (wall plaques and tablets; war memorials and large commemorative monuments) as well as the naming of streets. Given all this activity, museums form only a very small part of the way in which memories of war are perpetuated.</p>

                     <p>My subject is public history, history outside the academy, linking historians to the broad population interested – sometimes passionately interested – in historical inquiry. Public history is defined by this extension of the domain within which the scholar operates. The audience for historical literature defines the discipline as much as the professional credentials of the practitioner. Public history is thus an attempt to flee from the increasing specialisation and decreasing readership of professional academic work, both in journals and in monograph form. It is also a recognition that historical scholarship is intrinsically tied to concepts of educating the public, and</p>

                     <p>On 1August 1994, under a blistering sun, hundreds of<italic>Grenoblois</italic>lined the streets of their city to watch a drive-past of historic military vehicles. A military band played and a local choir sang the<italic>Chant des partisans</italic>. The crowd, moved to tears, reported the Dauphiné Libéré,¹ watched on as local children, dressed in white, collected around a huge urn. Some carried flaming torches, while others carried phials containing earth from the fifty-eight cantons of the departement of the Isère, which were solemnly emptied into the urn. There were speeches, dignitaries were present, the accent was on the ceremonial.</p>

                     <p>It is fairly common in France to speculate as to why it has taken such a long time to recognise the importance of preserving and promoting the heritage linked to France’s maritime past. This slow awakening applies to harbours and quaysides, rope-works, military dockyards as well as merchant craft, naval vessels and fishing fleets. The French, compared to the British or the Dutch, have in the past shown only a sporadic interest in the 4,500 kilometres of coastline which circumscribe their metropolitan territory. For the French, their country has been first and foremost a land mass: its coastal regions were</p>

                     <p>If only because of who its authors are, this apparently lighthearted quotation deserves a detailed analysis for several reasons: in fact practically every word in it poses an interesting problem; it ends with a question, the answer to which, while misleadingly tautological, is a stimulating enigma for all those concerned with heritage. The maritime scene will be the focus of our present study, but the difficulties encountered are of the same nature whether we consider rural, industrial or maritime heritage.</p>

                     <p>It may seem paradoxical to select a failed venture in a small Breton coastal town as an illustration of the enthusiasm felt by the French for maritime heritage at the present time. Yet the present case study seeks to illustrate some of the dangers, shortcomings and excesses related to maritime heritage, already highlighted by Françoise Péron (see Chapter 6) and by François Chappé (Chapter 7). This chapter examines the conflicts and contradictions which arose between interested parties in the political, economic, cultural and social fields when a new heritage structure was hurriedly set up in the 1990s in Douarnenez.

                     <p>The decision taken in 1984 to produce a compilation of the culinary heritage of France, defined as a cultural and economic inventory of traditional and regional food and cuisine,¹ reflects more than just a mere interest in the past. The creation of such an inventory illustrates the various social and economic transformations experienced by French society in recent decades. The crisis in French agriculture and the consequent restructuring of local identities have provided two of the principal driving forces behind these changes. In this context, culinary heritage can be represented as the point at which political, economic and social spheres</p>

There are important political, economic and social reasons for defining specific urban identities. The political reasons relate to successive urban regeneration initiatives since the early 1980s as well as decentralisation laws dating from the same period. Economic regeneration has a marked regional and local aspect, particularly since decentralisation, as mayors compete for business location and state funding on the basis of local</p>
