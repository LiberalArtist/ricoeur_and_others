         <p>This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.</p>

It is a path not easily discernible on the age-old map of theological reflection; it consists of several faint sidetracks and lines ending in what may</p>

                     <p>Is there something wrong with the modern mind? Does it suffer from a chronic disease? Can one detect symptoms of a potential malaise? There are a few solitary thinkers who, in a bold and curious manner, claim to have diagnosed what they see as a latent and threatening illness: the modern mind has lost its balance, it has become disproportioned and it even shows signs of a fatal disintegration. One such critical voice narrates the following etiology:</p>

                     <p>How can reason and sensibility fit together? What would be an adequate anthropology for capturing the essential unity of our humanity? For a full-fledged philosophical account of the tensile and delicate unity of the primordial human condition, I propose that we turn to Paul Ricoeur’s philosophical anthropology in his unjustly neglected early masterpiece,<italic>Fallible Man</italic>(1960).¹ The book was written as part of a vaster project that Ricoeur named philosophy of the will and that was initiated with an impressive study of the phenomenological structures of the will, entitled<italic>The Voluntary and the Involuntary</italic>(1950), and followed by the two-part</p>

                     <p>That there is no seamless continuity between philosophies of man and a theological vision of the human being is a case often made by theologians. What are, then, the distinguishing marks that delineate a truly theological anthropology? Is not the object of the two disciplines the same human being as situated in the world and as being in relation with the material, the natural, and the human sphere to which theological anthropology adds the dimension of relatedness to God in turn? What difference does a religious perspective make in our judgment of the true nature of the human person? Can</p>

The answer largely depends on the way the role of the emotions is defined within human life, namely, whether they are seen as belonging essentially to the body or whether they are viewed as being rooted in the soul. 1 Whether they are feared as irrational and harmful or whether they are thought to be an indispensable dimension of our rational humanity.

The issue of love governs Christian reflection on<italic>apatheia</italic>and gathers various aspects of image theology in one coherent whole, providing an organizing principle for seemingly disparate discourses, such as, creation, the state of original innocence, the fall, human morality, Christian discipleship, redemption, and divine immutability.

                     <p>What are the theological contours of human emotionality? This has been the guiding question throughout my inquiry. Does theological reflection furnish any graspable points of orientation concerning the significance of the emotions and affectivity besides the clearly formulated tenets it provides concerning the theological role of the intellect? In order to find an appropriate answer, I first had to delineate the context within which the issue can be adequately treated in a theological manner.
