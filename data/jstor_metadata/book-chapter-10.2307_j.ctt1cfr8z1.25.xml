         <p>This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.</p>

                     <p>This volume of edited papers is dedicated to the memory of John Evans in celebration of his contribution to environmental archaeology, providing a glimpse of the many ways in which he has enriched the subject and touched the lives of so many. It originated from a conference held in his memory at Cardiff in March 2006 which was an academically stimulating weekend with strong, vivid and poignant reminders of John and his engagement with students, people, ecology, the landscape, and their relevance to archaeology. Even John’s dogs, Jodie and Darwin, attended with Vivian Evans, the former making their presence heard</p>

                     <p>Environmental archaeology as a discipline relies, in many ways, upon data and parallels gained from, or observed in, biology and the real world. In some cases these observations are made on experiments ranging, from the reconstruction of field movements monuments (eg, Overton Down and Wareham earthwork experiments), to the results of dog-gnawing on bones. Where data are not present as analogues for palaeo-ecological interpretation we are often forced to become ecologists ourselves, and to record and map the ecology of species in their present day habitat.

                     <p>John ‘snails’ Evans, developed a whole new sub-discipline of palaeo-environmental enquiry for archaeology, advancing both the understanding of past landscapes and human activity, and that of palaeo-molluscan ecology. He was an influential figure both as an environmental archaeologist and prehistorian, and as an old-fashioned field naturalist. Although others before him (Zeuner, Dimbleby) had set the course, it was John who almost single-handedly developed the discipline of environmental archaeology and, in 1970, was appointed as lecturer of environmental archaeology at Cardiff, the first post of its kind outside London. He became a Reader in 1982, a Professor in 1994 and retired</p>

                     <p>The landscape around us is the very substance of archaeology. In it are the traces of past human activity that we seek to understand, many of those traces having originated in the response of earlier peoples to the landscape around them. That earlier landscape in turn bore the traces of yet earlier peoples’ ways of shaping and using the land. Successive generations of people living in a locality understand and respond to its particular characteristics in distinctive ways, thereby altering the content and appearance of that landscape for the future, whilst also responding to the landscape features and qualities that</p>

Thinking about ideas to do with flint knapping in close proximity to rivers, the sounds of flint knapping and why we find assemblages of certain flint material in certain places, we thought we would do some experimental archaeology. It was equally about having fun, fun with archaeology, and why not? There was no specific agenda to this exercise but, from the outset, John was the master of ceremonies. ‘So just for the record, it’s Kathryn and Steve</p>

                     <p>Experimental archaeology may be defined as the creation of activities and contexts in which ideas about the past can be thought through in practical terms and tested. For instance: how were artefacts made and buildings constructed; what residues are left of particular activities; and what is the capability of a boat? Experiments often mean that some parameters are controlled in order to make precise observations about others, such as the effects of time. The main syntheses of the subject were written 30 years ago or more (Coles 1973; 1979), even then it was a diverse field encompassing many distinct specialisms.</p>

                     <p>The vegetation history, and its relevance to early prehistoric (postglacial) human communities on the chalk downlands of southern England, was essentially clearly proven and defined in broad terms in the 1970s, largely through the work of John Evans (1971a; 1972; 1975; Evans &amp; Jones 1979). It was confirmed and re-affirmed by later workers (eg, Thomas 1982; Scaife 1980a) etc. Although shaken in the late 1980s by the arguments proffered by Bush and Flenley (1986) and Bush (1988), those arguments were fiercely countered by Thomas (Thomas 1989; Bush 1989).

                     <p>In<italic>Land snails and Archaeology</italic>(Evans 1972), John considered that temporal blurring and spatial mixing of snail populations into recovered covered assemblages made the interpretation of assemblages of from buried soils beneath monuments applicable to the wider environ- ment. He argued that ‘… in a relatively homogeneous environment, such as a cultivated field or chalk downland, the distribution and abundance of a species in the area as a whole tends to be uniform’ (p. 111), and was confident, at the time, that when open-country assemblages were recovered from buried soil surfaces, reflecting either grassland or cultivation prior to monument construction,</p>

                     <p>The Wylye valley, Wiltshire, downstream from Warminster, has seen remarkably little in the way of modern archaeological intervention. This, in large part, is due to the general lack of substantial development in any of the villages that lie along the river. Apart from work that preceded the construction of the Warminster and Codford bypasses on the main A36 trunk road in the early 1990s, the only major archaeological excavations have resulted from the need by the Army to construct new, permanent, range roads to facilitate the movement of heavy military vehicles within the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA), which lies</p>

It really arises from studying one area exceptionally well from a soils and pollen perspective, and then turning one’s attention to a new area – in this case the Cranborne Chase area of the Wessex chalk downlands, forcing a re-examination of an existing regional land-use model that has been thought to be well understood. John was always intrigued by what palaeosols could tell you about different landscape histories.

                     <p>The study of coasts and islands provides many opportunities. Many sites, now on our coast, may be presevered and protected by depositional processes enveloping them in sequences of blown sand, facilitating both exceptional preservation, and potentially great stratigraphic separation of sequences of activity such as at Gwithian, Brean Down, Nornour and Northton for instance. In many cases their costal position today may belie their location in prehistory. Conversely, others may be exposed by coastal erosion making them available for research for a short window of time before they are ultimately lost to us.

He was leading a student field trip in west Cornwall and because I had been involved in a major survey of prehistoric field patterns on the north Cornish coast, I was asked if I would lead John’s group around the sites in West Penwith. John was keen to see the results of this large-scale survey at first hand (at that time he was conducting his own field survey on the island of Skomer, Dyfed, Evans 1990, and he wanted to compare notes). All I knew about John was that he was a well-known environmental</p>

For an archaeologist, it is essential to take a copy of John Evans’ paper on the upstanding ‘almost certainly prehistoric’ archaeology of the island, or at the very least a copy of his excellent foldout map (Evans 1990, fig. 2). The product of five weeks’ work with Cardiff undergraduates, John’s Skomer paper represents a neat piece of fieldwork, which no doubt some day</p>

He studied shells, using their ecologies to help with understanding landscape, vegetation patterns, land-use and people. He worked with marine molluscs and discussed their exploitation as well as analysing assemblages from Wales with Vivian Evans. In all cases John was keenly aware of the ecology of the species under examination which was required for the first stage of interpretation – but then those data and interpretations were applied to archaeology; the interpretations were made valid and appropriate to the understanding of human communities, economies</p>

In the case of small bivalves of the genus<italic>Pisidium</italic>, the difficulties involved in their extraction and identification may be a contributory factor. Freshwater Mollusca are undoubtedly at their most valuable as part of a multi-proxy study, integrated as one of several sources of evidence.

                     <p>Current debates on the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition in Britain are largely focused around whether change occurred through indigenous acculturation through contact and innovation (eg, Thomas 2007) or whether new practices and material culture were introduced through the movement of people from the continent (eg, Sheridan 2007). These hypotheses are also concerned with the speed of change with views ranging from the idea that there was a rapid adoption of farming (eg, Rowley-Conwy 2004) to the stance that there was a gradual uptake of farming but a rapid ideological change (eg, Thomas 1999). However, it has been noted that these debates</p>

Some pollen analytical studies have also been undertaken, the most useful often being those from off-site locations where longer records may be recovered (Dark &amp; Dark 1997). Such pollen studies have enabled the reconstruction of the vegetational history and the nature of the regional landscape. Other proxies, such as land snails and small vertebrates, offer insights into the local environments at smaller spatial scales (cf. Evans &amp; Rouse 1992). These groups, which</p>

Hey of Oxford Archaeology on a high area of the floodplain of the Thames at Yarnton, Oxon, discovered a ditched rectangular enclosure of probable early Neolithic date. The primary cut of the ditch extended about 1.0m below the surface of the terrace gravels but the ditch had been recuttwice, once in the Middle Neolithic and again in the Middle Bronze Age. The argillic soils which developed above the limestone gravel terraces of the Upper Thames are not conducive to the survival of mollusc shells.

                     <p>All aspects of archaeology, including environmental archaeology and subdisciplines within it, are ultimately about people in the past. Archaeology has been good at studying the material world that humans have produced and the items they have made, but less good at attempting to understand the people themselves. Attempts to get into the minds of people long gone or to attempt in some small way to engage with their feelings and life styles have often been considered unscientific and unhelpful. Yet humans are a part of the natural world, and they modify it and act as communities within in. Their actions</p>

                     <p>John Evans hated formality; anything that involved suits, ties or agendas made him unhappy. This unease extended, I believe, to grand or over-abstract theorising. He was much more comfortable in informal settings; field trips, especially with a small group, or the task of cross-examining a section during excavation, were his<italic>forte</italic>. There he could bring to bear, in particular situations, his extraordinarily wide frame of reference. Looking back on his last two books,<italic>Land and Archaeology</italic>and<italic>Environmental Archaeology and the Social Order</italic>(Evans 1999; 2003), and especially the latter, one might be tempted to see a superficially anecdotal style,</p>

                     <p>For rural communities in medieval England few issues were as vital as soil fertility and few substances more important than manure. To the seigneurial and peasant farmer alike, the quality of manure and its availability were everyday concerns. How freely it could be applied and what might be used to make up the manure heap were significantly affected by social position. Lords had access to large flocks and herds, providing a ready supply of dung (Campbell 2000); they could demand that peasants fold their animals on demesne land, supplementing an already plentiful reserve; and through the labour services owed by</p>

                     <p>A man in Kolofana said ‘Things like that are primitive’ when I asked him about the threshing floors. A strange feeling that was – in the middle of nowhere there was a threshing floor – either up on the mountains where the actual process takes place or at the side of the village (Figs 20.1 &amp; 20.2).</p>
                     <p>At Tholaria, a village at the far north-eastern corner of the island, I asked a man to explain the process to me. They need animals to do the threshing – about 4 horses turning around and pressing the crop to come out – special precautions are needed</p>
