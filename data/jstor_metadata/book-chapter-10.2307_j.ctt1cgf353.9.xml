         <p>When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <p>When J.E. Lesslie Newbigin retired from missionary service and returned to Britain in 1974, he discovered that his homeland was as much of a mission field as India. While he had been in constant contact with Britain and the West throughout his missionary career, what he saw upon his return ignited his missionary spirit and caused him to set out in retirement to discover the cause of the problem and propose an answer. It was not that he would discover something new; in fact, he had the answer all along but had to articulate it anew for the new context.</p>

At the end of the twentieth century this honor, it would seem, fell upon Lesslie Newbigin, long time missionary to India and global ecumenical leader.</p>

                     <p>J. h. Oldham, one of early twentieth century’s greatest missionary statesmen, planted in Newbigin’s mind the idea that the Western world is a potential place for mission. Oldham was present at the ecumenical conference held in Jerusalem in 1928 and he began to raise questions about the gospel and secular culture, but they were not perceived as central to the missionary concerns of the time. They reappeared at The Edinburgh Quadrennial of 1933. Newbigin recalls:</p>

                     <p>Throughout his career, Newbigin wrote on such theological topics as the doctrine of God, the Trinity, the doctrine of creation, Christology, sin and salvation, the church, and so forth. George Hunsberger observes:</p>
                     <p>A survey of Newbigin’s thought makes it obvious that at the most basic levels the major concerns to which he tended to give theological attention and the major insights which lie at the heart of his reflections were to a remarkable degree formed during his early years, particularly those spent as an undergraduate at Cambridge, as a staff worker for the SCM in Scotland, and at Cambridge again</p>

                     <p>Newbigin’s view of humanity is one that acknowledges human sinfulness while maintaining the value and worth of human persons as God’s creation. His methodology is to discuss Christian doctrine in dialogue with the Enlightenment and post-modern thinking. The Enlightenment sought to free humanity from the ‘ dogma’ of original sin because they believed that “the most dangerous and destructive of all the dogmas which have perverted human reason is the dogma of original sin.”¹ Enlightenment thinkers saw the significance of the doctrine of original sin as central to the whole Christian ‘system.’ If humanity is not, in fact, sinful, then</p>

                     <p>Newbigin utilizes the theological convictions he developed over the years as a standard of evaluation when confronting contemporary Western culture. “The gospel,” he writes, “provides the stance from which all culture is to be evaluated.”¹ What emerges in Newbigin’s engagement with Western culture is a theology of mission that meshes his theological convictions with the post-critical assumptions of Charles Cochrane and Michael Polanyi.</p>
                     <p>It was the gospel story, Newbigin believes, that distinguished Europe from Asia. In the gospel, truth is taught by way of a story, a series of historical events that were part the history and tradition of Israel,</p>

                     <p>Newbigin’s answer to Western culture’s dilemma is essentially a theological response based on the theological convictions presented earlier in this book. In this case, he turns his attention toward Western culture which he believes to be in need of a radical conversion of both spirit and mind.</p>
                     <p>Newbigin begins by asking questions that go to the heart of his desire to see Western culture experience a missionary confrontation:</p>
                     <p>Who will confront this culture of ours with the claim of absolute truth, the claim that Jesus Christ is the truth? Who will be bold enough to say, not that Christian message</p>

                     <p>Throughout the previous chapters, there have been numerous references to the church, usually in connection to some task or action that Newbigin believes the church must perform to confront Western culture. While the emphasis thus far has been on the substance of Newbigin’s theology in the face of the challenge of the Enlightenment ideology, it would be incorrect to conclude that what Newbigin envisions is somehow confined to mere words, as important as words are. His theology includes, in fact<italic>culminates in</italic>, his vision for a community of faith that would live out its faith in contemporary Western culture.</p>

There are, however, some further contributions that become apparent as one does an exposition of his theological and missiological thinking. There are also some challenges to his thinking that need to be addressed. Newbigin is not the first to confront Western culture as a missionary in the Twentieth Century. Francis Schaeffer, for example, began to discern the real issues of Western culture in the middle of the last century. While he believed them to be theological in origin, he saw them manifested in philosophy, art, and literature. Schaeffer’s attitude</p>
