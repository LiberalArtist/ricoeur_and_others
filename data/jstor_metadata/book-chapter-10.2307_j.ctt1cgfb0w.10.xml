         <p>What is history? This question can be taken in many ways, including radically skeptical ones, but in 'Allegorizing History' Timothy J. Furry asks the questions not with that axe to grind but because it has become clear to him, through study of Bede and other ancient Christians, that history is not so simple. To be sure, many, if not all scholars, know that thanks to the work of postmodern philosophers and twentieth-century historical theorists like R.G. Collingwood, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Hayden White. In this work, Furry shows that there are competing notions and purposes of historical practice, more specifically between Bede and the scholars who have recently studied him. Moreover, he explaisn why this difference matters and what implications result from such competing notions and practices of history, especially in the exegesis of Scripture as well as how exegesis also influences conceptions of history. Following a tradition of historians and theologians who have sought to blur the lines between theology and other disciplines, Furry explores how, if biblical exegesis was not an isolated discipline for ancient and medieval Christians, then its effects should be seen in other arenas. His argument here is that one of these arenas or disciplines is history.</p>

                     <p>As with scholarship on any historical figure, much has changed in how the Venerable Bede has been understood, specifically as an historian and with respect to what he was trying to accomplish in his<italic>Historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum</italic>. This chapter will explore historiographical issues beginning with Plummer’s introduction to the 1896 edition of the<italic>Historia</italic>and ending with more recent publications on Bede and his histories. I will show how scholars wrestled with integrating Bede’s theological, exegetical, and historical works into even a quasi-coherent account throughout the twentieth century, while highlighting theoretical obstacles that caused them difficulties.

                     <p>The preceding chapter showed that Bede did not figurally exegete events in the English Church’s history, despite frequent opportunities to do so. I will argue in this chapter that Bede’s commentary on Genesis and how he reads the creation of time, history, and the world displays a theological and philosophical ambiguity that factors into how Bede conceives of God’s action or providential caring for history and humanity. Using<italic>In genesim</italic>as my point of departure, I am following Charles Jones who describes Bede’s commentary as “God’s Word on Nature and Grace.”¹ In order to highlight what I think are Bede’s</p>

                     <p>Before transitioning to the subject for this chapter, a brief recounting of my argument to this point seems appropriate. Along with summarizing contemporary scholarship on Bede’s<italic>Historia</italic>and exegesis, Chapter 1 alluded to the fact that reading Bede in light of modern historical methods and presumptions results in distortion. Part of that discussion revolved around the status of the past and its relationship to the present. The work of Charles Jones made such issues come to the fore in my historiography, specifically Jones’s application of the categories of realist and romantic to Bede, and Jan Davidse applied such concerns to</p>

                     <p>Up to this point, I have tried to show how Bede’s practice of history was deeply theological yet ran into some difficulties that someone like Augustine was able to avoid when he came to the literal sense of Genesis 1. One of these problems revolves around how language refers in its literal and historical usage. Recall that Bede read the days in Genesis 1 as literal 24-hour days, despite Augustine’s unwillingness to affirm such a reading in his literal commentary on Genesis. For Bede the literal and the allegorical were in tension with each other; when one moves to allegory,</p>

                     <p>For the sake of clarification, and since my argument has ventured across disciplines and time periods, I want to reiterate and summarize my argument and what it has accomplished. Chapter 1 set the stage in two ways for my argument. First, by tracing the fault lines in contemporary Bedan scholarship regarding his<italic>Ecclesiastical History</italic>I put my own argument within a specific contemporary conversation. Second, I teased out implicit historiographical, philosophical, and theological issues within that scholarly conversation germane to my point regarding the ability to understand Bede’s sense of history in light of the differences between modern approaches (e.g.</p>
