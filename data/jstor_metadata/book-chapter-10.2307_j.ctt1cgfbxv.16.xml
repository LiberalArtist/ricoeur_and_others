      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.</p>

                     <p>The ultimate gloom, vulgarity, grim severity, horror, even apparent conceptual paradoxes, in Christian testimonies to divine suffering repel many people in their initial encounters with various forms of this Christian symbol.ยน Such revulsion for language that attributes suffering to God, however, may surprise contemporary Christians who easily attribute all sorts of emotions and experiences to God and may lead such Christians to criticize classical Christian theism itself, when they discover how the vast majority of official teachings and dogmas of orthodox Christianity (Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and many of the major Protestant denominations that emerged from the reformations of the</p>

In one sense, this chapter initiates that interaction, since it provides a hypothetical overview of the symbolโs structure. In another sense, however, this chapter retains its orienting character, in that it does not yet<italic>fully</italic>begin to interpret actual Christian attestations to divine suffering.

In the chapters that follow, I will examine this symbolโs two principal presuppositions, both of which taken together supply part two of this book with its title: Presuppositions of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering.

This first stage of my analysis works on the basis of an abstraction of divine life or being from divine activity, in order to clarify the characteristic ways in which this symbol envisions the actualization of divine love in divine creative activity.

The present chapter examines the character of Godโs creative activity, as determined by the divine being, in order to disclose the meaning of the first presupposition for the Christian symbol of divine suffering as well as to illumine the basis upon which to analyze this symbolโs second presupposition.

                     <p>This chapter develops the first half of an exposition of the second major presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. As I have mentioned already, most specifically, this presupposition takes the following form:<italic>God has created human life or being, through the actualization of the divine being as love in Godโs self-limiting creative activity, in the image of God with the being or life of love</italic>. Working on the basis of the abstraction of being or life from its actualization, this chapter will identify and analyze the formal and material structures of the human as the image of God,</p>

                     <p>In moving from the distinction between human being and human action to their union, through the present consideration of human beingโs actualization, I note again the abstract character of this distinction: human being always remains, and one can examine it empirically only as,<italic>ens actu</italic>, being-in-act. Also, the insights that this abstraction discloses about this symbolโs anthropological presupposition refer to aspects of essential human being.</p>
                     <p>So far, my analyses have identified both formally and materially the structural characteristics of human being in this anthropological presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering, characteristics of authentic human being or human being</p>

                     <p>As stated in chapter 2, every religious symbol expresses, either explicitly or implicitly, a threefold referentiality: (1) reference to some notion of ultimate reality, the sacred, or God; (2) reference to a concept of the human; and (3) reference to a specific vision of the world. The Christian symbol of divine suffering naturally exhibits that threefold referentiality in both the explicit symbol and its twofold presupposition. Thus, in these two primary presuppositions, the human and God do not relate to one another in some sort of vacuum. The human (ฮ ฮฌฮฝฮธฯฯฯฮฟฯ) and God (ฮ ฮธฮตฯฯ) relate to one another in</p>

                     <p>In this study, I have aimed both to establish an approach to the Christian symbol of divine suffering and to inaugurate the first stages of an interpretation of this symbol through an analysis of its two principal presuppositions. The dialectical network between these two presuppositions constitutes the symbol of divine vulnerability: the symbolic condition of possibility for all forms or modes of actual divine suffering, according to the Christian symbol of divine suffering.</p>
                     <p>My interpretation of this symbolโs construal of divine vulnerability, consequently, requires me to step across, to trans-gress, the gaps between this first volume in my study of</p>
