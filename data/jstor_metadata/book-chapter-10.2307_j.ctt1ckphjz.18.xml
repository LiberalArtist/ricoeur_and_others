                     <p>Technological changes have had a dramatic impact upon the financing, organization and delivery of health care services in Canada. Professionals and health care decision makers now wrestle with increasingly complex sets of challenges that must involve various types of professionals in programs of care. The result is that administrators, nurses, physicians, social workers and other professionals have had diverse roles to play in programs of care and, consequently, have insisted that their voices be heard in the decision-making process alongside the voices of patients and their families. Needless to say, the ensuing discussions have become difficult because the diverse professional</p>

                     <p>The revival of interest in ethical issues concerning biomedicine and health care in the mid-sixties was undoubtedly a search for meaning. Not only was it a protest against certain types of experimentation on human subjects, it also represented a desire to make medicine a more humane enterprise. Whatever interpretation the ethical project of the time took—for example, Van Potter and André Hellegers developed different approaches to bioethics—the revival was oriented toward a promotion of the kind of medicine that is moral.</p>
                     <p>In this search for meaning, methodological issues could not be avoided. On the contrary, they were an</p>

We begin with a general sociohistorical sketch from which we observe the emergence of indicators that form the dimensions of the “implicit ethics” of three ideal types of nurses. This is followed by an illustration of how each of the ideal types addresses the four ethical themes of concern in this study: autonomy, economics, location of care and decision making. The chapter concludes with a synthesis that presents the nurse as moral agent and with concluding statements. In order to provide the</p>

In the course of the documentary analysis on the social worker, having used a corpus of literature comparable to that for physicians and nurses, it became evident that our discussion of the social worker would be different. First of all, it is clear that for the social worker in the field of pediatric chronic illness, there</p>

                     <p>Currently, health care practitioners who must wrestle with ethical issues in their daily work experience are confronted with a diversity of theories and principles in the field of ethics. Professionals do not have a standardized set of ethical tools and methods for deliberating and deciding on issues. Rather, they must choose among diverse sets of such tools. Furthermore, their own personal choices are never the last word. They must work with other professionals whose approaches to ethics are often quite different. These differences often give rise to conflicts. In health care institutions, these conflicts often must be resolved through discourse</p>

                     <p>One of the fundamental assumptions of the liberal tradition of democracy, and so of the institutions nourished explicitly or implicitly by that tradition, is that there are a plurality of values that can conflict with one another and that are not reducible to one another. Consequently, it is widely accepted that value conflicts will not be eliminated. We do not expect to resolve our value conflicts to the satisfaction of all parties.¹ However, this belief sets up a problem for social living. How can this irreducible pluralism of values be combined with a notion of legitimate social or collective action?</p>

                     <p>The focus of the proceduralists (e. g., Habermas, Rawls, Ackerman) is on the structure of ethical discourse and/or the political contracts and institutions that establish procedures for adjudicating conflicting value claims. Their interest is in general structural features that operate in all ethical discourse regardless of context or ethical content. In their view, all participants are rationally bound to accept these norms</p>

                     <p>Conflicts among professionals in health care teams often involve differences over values. As was observed in part 1, these value differences are often implicit and are often related to the diverse ways in which professionals of different types understand themselves and their work. The field of conflict resolution has developed a range of insights into the dynamics of conflicts and a range of tools for helping disputants move toward resolution in situations of conflict. In this chapter we will examine some contributions from this field, particularly those contributions that lend themselves to better understanding value conflicts in health care contexts.</p>

Chapter 6, by James Sauer, identified two main lines of theory in this field—the proceduralists and the contextualists—and provided preliminary arguments for the complementarity of the two. Chapter 7, by Kenneth R. Melchin, introduced the cognitional theory of Bernard Lonergan as an ethical framework for the project and drew upon insights from Lonergan scholarship to identify how proceduralists, contextualists and cognitional theorists can contribute to an understanding of ethical discourse in health care teams.

                     <p>Part 3 of this study takes the results of parts 1 and 2 and applies them to a case-study, action-research context. Two teams of health care professionals from Anglophone and Francophone pediatric chronic care institutional settings volunteered to participate in videotaped discussions of case studies involving ethical issues typically encountered in their work. These videos were then examined by the research team in the light of the analyses of parts 1 and 2. In keeping with the overall goals of this study, the observers focussed on the ethical deliberation process. We sought to determine whether insights from the implicit ethics</p>

                     <p>The goal of this chapter is to stand back and reflect on the whole project, to ask about the overall framework that guided the research and developed through the project and to examine how this framework unified the various parts of the project. While the theoretical literature in ethics is massive and diverse, three central concerns guided the development of the theoretical framework.</p>
                     <p>The first concern was linked to the two practical goals of the project: (1) to help understand value conflicts and ethical decision making in the concrete experiences of multiprofessional health care teams; and (2) to develop tools</p>

                     <p>The changing face of health care has made the task of patient care much more complex than in past decades. This is especially the case in the field of chronic care.
