         <p>What does it mean to be French? What constitutes "Frenchness"? Is it birth, language, attachment to republicanism, adherence to cultural norms? In contemporary France, these questions resonate in light of the large number of non-French and non-European immigrants, many from former French colonies, who have made France home in recent decades. Historically, French identity has long been understood as the product of a centralized state and culture emanating from Paris that was itself central to European history and civilization. Likewise, French identity in terms of class, gender, nationality, and religion mainly has been explained as a strong, indivisible core, against which marginal actors have been defined.</p>
         <p>This collection of essays offers examples drawn from an imperial history of France that show the power of the periphery to shape diverse and dynamic modern French identities at its center. Each essay explains French identity as a fluid process rather than a category into which French citizens (and immigrants) are expected to fit. In using a core/periphery framework to explore identity creation,<italic>Views from the Margins</italic>breaks new ground in bringing together diverse historical topics from politics, religion, regionalism, consumerism, nationalism, and gendered aspects of civic and legal engagement.</p>

                     <p>What constitutes “Frenchness”? Until recently we thought we knew. After all, France is regarded as “the oldest nation of Europe,” a recognizable geographic and political entity dating from the early Middle Ages. Fernand Braudel, arguably France’s most influential historian of the twentieth century, has located the essence of French identity in the deeper patterns of French geography, demography, and the environment that emerged over centuries.¹ France has been historically at the center of Europe in terms of power and the influence of its culture and civilization. As early as the thirteenth century, students from across Europe attended the University of</p>

                     <p>On the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination in 1979, Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre (1905–91) gave a sermon at a Parisian church crowded with supporters of his traditionalist Catholic vision, opposed to the liturgical and theological reforms of the Vatican II council of the 1960s. As a result of the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church significantly changed its practices. These innovations included the use of vernacular languages during church services, the full endorsement of democratic institutions, and the abandonment of earlier views deemed as overtly anti-Semitic. Lefebvre was opposed to these changes and became a leading conservative critic of</p>

                     <p>In 1926 the Michelin tire company published a guide to Brittany, the company’s first regional touring guide. A precursor of the oblong green guides, Michelin’s new regional guide offered some background information and then traced various itineraries, allowing automobile tourists to find the noteworthy tourist sites by following the more picturesque routes. Similar guides soon covered much of the French countryside. Like the earlier red guide and Michelin’s other tourist initiatives, the regional guides strongly encouraged well-heeled French to take their automobiles and see France, to taste regional gastronomy, to savor fine wines, and to appreciate how regional differences came</p>

                     <p>In William Cohen’s study of modernization in five provincial cities in nineteenth-century France, he found that city dwellers often were drawn into the intense battles between local and national interests as the urban facade yielded to unprecedented change. Citizens inevitably went along with their civic leaders’ advice for renewal and rejected counsel that was nationally based. As Cohen writes, “To be sure, cities were not insular. Their inhabitants increasingly were swept up in the national ideologies and movements. Yet municipal leaders were able to forge and maintain a sense of unity that lent the regional city significance.”¹ In this light</p>

                     <p>Emblematic of the complexity of Alsatian identity and its role as a border area between Germany and France is an Alsatian folk ditty that goes, “Hans in Schnockeloch has all that he wants. And what he has he doesn’t want, and what he wants he doesn’t have. Hans in Schnockeloch has all that he wants.”¹ A pro-German, pro-Nazi folklorist, Karl Roos, popularized this piece of doggerel during the 1920s as part of an anti-French movement.² The expression of ambivalence—simultaneously desiring inclusion and chafing at external control—aptly characterizes Alsatian identity throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and into World War II.</p>

                     <p>The international socialist and labor movement of Europe was the largest global social movement in the pre–World War I era. Uniting diverse socialist and labor parties under a loosely knit organization known as the Second International (1889–1914), it stood as the model for political mobilization and social change. At its height the Second International encompassed labor and socialist organizations in more than twenty countries across Europe and even had links with organizations in North America, South America, Africa, and Asia. The success of the movement was rooted in an evolving political culture centered on mass-based political performances such</p>

                     <p>In the early years of the Napoleonic regime (1799–1815) a new craze hit Paris high society: a vogue for self-help manuals that taught readers the art of having gifted, healthy, and beautiful children— preferably boys.

Brigitte Bardot may some day be elected to the Collège de France. Simone Signoret is virtually there already. The intellectual is the one in whose discourse the public hears, directly or indirectly, the echo of its ultimate ends. One is an intellectual only on the basis of elective criteria.¹</p>

                     <p>The private and most intimate lives of many Parisians involved communication and travel between the core capital city and regions on the periphery—the rural areas within France and the more distant colonies.¹ Since early modern times, men and women moved to and from Paris and the other departments within France in carrying out their social, marital, and sexual relationships. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries people also went to the colonies, specifically to Algeria and Indochina (present-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Communication between Paris and the periphery did not stop during the Occupation and Vichy governments of the wartime</p>
