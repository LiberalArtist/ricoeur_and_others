         <p>This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's<italic>Royal Commentaries of the Incas</italic>presented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies of<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>previously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.</p>

                     <p>The central idea for this volume on the seminal<italic>Royal Commentaries of the Incas</italic>and<italic>General History of Peru</italic>(1609) by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539–1616) is to bring together, in a single volume in English, key essays authored by some of the most distinguished students of Inca Garcilaso’s work. Thus far, most of the book-length scholarship on Inca Garcilaso’s work has been published in Spanish, with the notable exception of John Grier Varner’s<italic>El Inca: The Life and Times of Garcilaso de la Vega</italic>(1968) and Margarita Zamora’s<italic>Language, Authority, and Indigenous History in the Comentarios reales</italic>

The Spanish encountered Atahualpa, the reigning Inca in Cajamarca and, after putting him in chains, garroted him. In 1534, Captain Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas arrived in Peru with the expedition of Pedro de Alvarado, and after Alvarado left for Guatemala, Garcilaso, who stayed in Peru, was sent by Pizarro to conquer new lands. He was recalled to Lima to help Pizarro after the Manco Inca rebellion in 1536, and from Lima he was sent to Cusco, where the Manco Inca rebellion was followed by the war between</p>

                     <p>Studies on Inca Garcilaso have paid little attention to the coat of arms that appears in the frontispiece of the first edition of the<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>(1609).¹ Indeed, this is so much the case that most modern editions do not even include a reproduction of it.² I argue here that the analysis of the symbols represented in Garcilaso’s heraldic insignia is of the utmost importance for an interpretation of this work. Those same symbols are extremely relevant for an interpretation of Garcilaso’s self-fashioning of his mestizo identity.³</p>

                     <p>This analysis of Garcilaso’s<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>offers an alternative reading of the text, based on the confluence and superimposition of Andean and European discourses—at times coincident, at times counterpoised.¹ Such a reading advances the outlines of a colonial writing subject who manifests himself through a discourse that is in and of itself a palimpsest. Just like the worn parchment with its many layers of writing, this multilayered discourse implies a simultaneity of positions that are not necessarily harmonious. I am referring to a kind of syncretism that embodies multiple meanings and values; different readers will appreciate the meanings and</p>

                     <p>Read, glossed, cited, and paraphrased, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>(1609) have enjoyed enormous acclaim from readers since their first appearance at the beginning of the seventeenth century.¹ The existence of numerous translations into most modern languages proves their success in Europe. Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

                     <p>Until the end of the nineteenth century, the work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (Cusco 1539–Córdoba 1616) was considered to be the definitive work of reference for studying the history of the<italic>Incario</italic>.¹The discovery of new documents and the publication of chronicles unknown in the first decades of the twentieth century illuminated aspects of Garcilaso’s biography and produced significant changes in the evaluation of his work as well as the trustworthiness of his data. In the second half of the twentieth century, new approaches became oriented toward considering Garcilaso’s writing as a function of the creative imagination. These</p>

Up to the late nineteenth century, Garcilaso’s account had been taken as the most accomplished historical depiction of the Inca, but the discovery of new written and archeological sources and the emergence of modern historiography source criticism led historians and anthropologists to challenge its truthfulness. As a result, Garcilaso’s<italic>history</italic>lost credibility. At the same time, the<italic>narrative</italic>was hailed as possessing the</p>

                     <p>Historian Carmen Bernand expressed her alarm following the emphatic declaration of Cusco writer Luis Nieto during the presentation of his 2007 novel, Asesinato en la gran ciudad del Cuzco. “I detest Inca Garcilaso!” Nieto said, because he is an “emblem of a mestizaje that only exists discursively” (in<italic>La república</italic>, February 21, 2007; Bernand, 96–99). As with almost all national definitions of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, we may say that Nieto is both right and wrong. That is, Nieto has translated poorly, in both the literal and figurative senses. He should have said: “I hate the Peruvian state,</p>

Initially Locke’s “Promises and Bargains for Truck, &amp; c . between two Men in the Desert Island, mentioned by Garcilasso De la vega, in his<italic>History of Peru</italic>” (<italic>Two Treatises</italic>, 276; section 14) affords precious little territory upon</p>

                     <p>This chapter examines the production of discourses at the crossroads of domination and subversion in early colonial Peru. It presents an alternative interpretation of one of the main texts of the Amerindian intellectual production, the first part of Garcilaso’s<italic>Royal Commentaries of the Incas</italic>. By reading it as a two-layered text, an expression of double consciousness, I argue that the<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>can be seen as a paradigmatic example of signifying in subaltern colonial texts that advance a theory of practice.</p>

But is it really? In asking the question “what is literature?” or “what is a genre?” we are confronted with a complex problem. One could answer the question in a straightforward manner, simply stating that literature is everything that our traditions recognize as literature and that genres are categories of texts, such as chronicles or missionary plays.

                     <p>Every form of cultural identity is inauthentic, a kind of imposture. But because of the circumstances of Spanish colonialism, Latin American cultural identity is perhaps especially so. I am far from having the scholarly authority to speak about Inca Garcilaso de la Vega or his work. At best, I know it superficially. But I know enough to at least suggest that Garcilaso might be said to be the founding moment of that Latin American cultural in authenticity. To celebrate the anniversary of<italic>Royal Commentaries</italic>is also to mark a limit to a certain conception of Latin American identity that sees</p>
