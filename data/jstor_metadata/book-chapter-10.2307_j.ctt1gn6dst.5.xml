      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.</p>

                     <p>The announcement that Modiano had won the 2014 Nobel Prize for Literature came, it seems, as a surprise to many. ‘Patrick Modiano plutôt que Philip Roth, ou Haruki Murakami. Les académiciens suédois qui attribuent le prix Nobel de littérature ne détestent pas étonner le monde. Mais si la surprise est de taille, elle est aussi excellente’.¹ His French readers were surprised, then delighted; a popular writer since the publication of his very first novels, Modiano has been a steadfast bestseller in his native country for well over forty years. Readers, critics and journalists were united in their delight that the</p>

                     <p>All of Modiano’s eighteen novels to date, except for one,¹ are narrated in the first person. It is always the same kind of first person: tall, dark, reserved and slightly bumbling, he is also always engaged in a search for something in the past, either his own or someone else’s. He is the likeable if rather underconfident guide who takes the reader through the plot and on this search, which also always ends in relative failure.²</p>
                     <p>However, this Modiano narrator is as mysterious as he is familiar. In spite of speaking in the first person, he never reveals much of</p>

                     <p>Modiano’s novels are full of dates. The narrators seem to take much pleasure in specifying precisely when certain events took place, whether in their own lives or in someone else’s. Chapters and paragraphs frequently start with a date reference: ‘Hier, 1er octobre de dix-neufcent quatre-vingt quatorze, je suis revenu chez moi, de la place d’Italie, par le métro.’ 1 Or: ‘J’ai connu Francis Jansen quand j’avais dix–neuf ans, au printemps de 1964 …’² These are especially useful given that Modiano’s novels all deal with is explorations into the past, various levels of the past, made accessible through long</p>

                     <p>It is often assumed that Modiano is a ‘realist’. One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in</p>

                     <p>Modiano is still best known for writing novels set in the Occupation. His apparent obsession, especially in his earlier works, with this dark period of French history has been the main concern of his critics and reviewers. It is certainly a controversial subject: it was one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter. What is the nature of Modiano’s treatment of the subject? Is it</p>

                     <p>We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be playful subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre</p>

                     <p>Modiano may be both serious and playful, but above all he is popular. His novels sell extremely well: they are always on the best-seller lists when they first appear, and even his older works display staying power on the market. What are the reasons for this popularity, structurally and ‘socially’ speaking? Is there a certain novelistic genre or structure related to popularity? What is the social status of that kind of novel?</p>

                     <p>In Modiano’s novels of the seventies, eighties and early nineties, the young female characters tended not to be very developed, broadly speaking: they were fairly generic ‘mystery women’ who attracted the young male narrator, often leading him to make undesirable acquaintances, and then disappearing without explanation, breaking his heart and giving him a reason to write about the experience. They were often a little, at times much, older than him, and their lives subordinate to that of the male narrator, both in narrative terms—that is to say, they were never narrators—and in terms of sheer content. But this</p>

                     <p>As I discussed in Chapter 6 of this book, the ‘sameness’ of Modiano’s novels is a characteristic that seems to stem from a variety of reasons, with equally various effects. Sometimes seen as a result of certain autobiographical compulsions,¹ it is a quality of which the author himself cannot be unaware, and which indeed he has been seen to parody in an arguably postmodern acknowledgement of both the ‘Modiano novel’ and correspondingly typical ‘Modiano criticism’.² On the levels of structure, themes, tone and atmosphere, his most recent books have remained eminently recognisable as ‘Modiano novels’, so much so that a</p>
