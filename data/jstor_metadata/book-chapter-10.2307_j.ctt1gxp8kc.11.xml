                     <p>The title of this collection may prompt two types of reaction. For some, it is inappropriate to talk about the resurgence of phenomena that have become established and ‘mainstream’. Personal freedoms in sexual relations, artistic expression and ongoing campaigns for equal rights have all become institutionalised in the past 40 years. However for other readers, familiar with the extravagant mission of the counter-culture and the shrivelling of revolutionary – or pseudo-revolutionary – politicking, the ‘spirit of the 60s’ may be thought of as beyond resuscitation. As one seasoned political journalist recently opined: ‘1968 was not a beginning – it was</p>

                     <p>There is an influential historical consensus that 1960s radicalism in Britain had no significant or lasting impact on the social and political order. In this view, the longer-term effects of the ideas and movements, often associated with the climactic year of 1968, have been confined to popular culture, life-styles and inter-personal relations. It is said that political institutions remained unperturbed and almost unaffected by the intellectual and ideological ferment occurring in the arts, media, universities, street politics and youth cultures. From this historical-empiricist perspective the significance of ’68 in Britain was apolitical and confined to the personal and cultural sphere</p>

                     <p>On 15 March 1968 France’s most important newspaper,<italic>Le Monde</italic>, published an editorial by Pierre Viansson-Ponté, its chief political writer, entitled ‘France is bored’ (Viansson-Ponté 1968). The author, a former member of the Resistance and one of the country’s most respected political commentators, bemoaned the fact that France was ‘removed from the convulsions reshaping the world’, a place where ‘nothing is happening’. He observed in passing that a few students were demonstrating at Nanterre University for the right of female students to enter the male dormitories, dismissing this as ‘despite everything, a limited conception of human rights’.

                     <p>If the slogan ‘make love, not war’ became a constantly evoked symbol of the kind of protest generated in the ‘long sixties’ (Jameson 1984; Marwick 1998, 16–20), the fact is that the attitudes and discourses that originated in this period have not always corresponded to this pacifist image, at times understood retrospectively as parodic, individualistic and carefree. In different times and places, at a gradually more intense pace, the new youth culture introduced profound changes in the fields of customs, taste and morality, and set in motion modes of daring and resistance which often evolved towards open confrontation with</p>

                     <p>Two major discourses of change in the 1960s, student revolt and black consciousness, were introduced to South Africa primarily through, literature, music, and individual agency. The knowledge transfer helped to define and transform resistance to apartheid from liberal expressions and values to ideologically informed New Left activism. The impact of this shift and the forms it took had highly significant long term outcomes for South Africa, but the perception of South Africa as an isolated place disconnected from early forms of globalization has become a self reflective trope and the significance of links with global changes are not recognized.</p>

                     <p>In 1968 on the completion of ten years of autocratic rule, Pakistan’s first military dictator, General Ayub Khan decided to celebrate ‘the decade of development’. The Ayub regime had achieved the fastest economic growth in Pakistan’s history and was lauded in the West as a dynamic model for Third World capitalism. Despite this, inequality and the percentage of the population living below the poverty line had increased. Wealth was concentrated in few hands and the country’s twenty-two richest families controlled approximately 90 percent of the assets of financial institutions. In 1968 disillusioned students, workers and peasants, as well as members</p>

                     <p>The purpose of this chapter is to explain the rise, character and trajectory of radicalism in the United States during ‘the long nineteen sixties’ and to comment on its significance to some of today’s related issues. For comparative purposes, I will also refer to nineteen sixties radicalism in Britain. My already smouldering interest in American radicalism was ignited in 1968 when as a student I attended the ‘alternative’ democratic convention in Chicago, if ‘attended’ is the right word to describe the heavily policed gatherings of assorted radicals in the parks and streets outside the official Convention Hall. Since then I</p>

                     <p>As the highpoint of sixties radicalism, 1968 was a year of action. This was certainly true for London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts which moved that year from its small premises in Dover Street to its current grander location on the Mall. However, Roland Barthes comments that, ‘every national shock produces a sudden flowering of written commentary’ (1968, 149) and 1968 was also a year of prolific written documentation. The immediacy of 1968’s historicization not only reveals its importance, but also its compromises and failures, as writers struggled to make sense of its disparate aims and ideological absences. America may have</p>

                     <p>The above quotation to some extent encapsulates the Situationists’ perspective on revolutionary theory. Put simply, the Situationists did not believe in either waiting for a revolution or deferring the living of life until after this possibly hypothetical point. The claim that ‘everybody wants to breathe’ describes the existence of a human spirit which can be truly revolutionary when brought to the surface. ‘Nobody can breathe’ depicts the ‘spectacular’ world in which we live, mired in the illusion of mainstream society</p>

                     <p>This chapter will focus, from a quantitative and longitudinal perspective, on the cohorts who experienced and were involved in those sixties events often symbolized by reference to the climactic year 1968. It looks in particular at the connection between education and values and unconventional political participation. As education has been a major characteristic of the active sixties generation, educational level and educational expansion will be theorised to analyse social mechanisms behind the sixties movement and its development. We will compare the sixties generation – the birth cohorts 1946–53 at the core – to other earlier and later cohorts regarding</p>

                     <p>Where have the revolutions gone? What happens with the passion of the day once movements are no longer publicly visible – what does it transform into? And what are the lessons learned? Our concern in this chapter is to critically examine the idealism of political movements following the moment of 1968, by listening to the voices of adults who have been engaged in a range of activist projects over their lifetime. Our discussion is founded on in-depth life story interviews with adults in the UK, however to contextualize and analyse this material we draw on theories about new social movements</p>

Carol Hanisch, a community organiser for the Southern Conference Educational Fund, was responding to a memo by another staff member. Like so many other activists in the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, and the New Left, this colleague did not view the fledgling women’s liberation movement as truly political. Dottie Zellner had been particularly scathing about the new vogue for consciousness-raising, which she dismissed as therapy.</p>

                     <p>This book began by contrasting polarised interpretations of the longer term impact of sixties radicalism. One cluster sees cultural, social and political rebellion as ephemeral, politically inconsequential or absorbed into the mainstream. Others see legacies and practices from sixties radicalism as established and still influential in contemporary radical protest. This divergence is illustrated by the views of two Americans: Noam Chomsky (2009) and Gerard DeGroot (2008). On the BBC world news programme<italic>Hardtalk</italic>(November 3 2009) Chomsky consistently attributed what he sees as an increase in freedom of expression in American public life to the long-term impact of the radical</p>
