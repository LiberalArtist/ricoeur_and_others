         <p>This book explores the memory of the First Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919, which proved crucial for communist Hungarian political culture throughout the twentieth century.

                     <p>What makes abstract historical interpretations authentic? This theoretical question troubled Communist Party leaders and propaganda historians in Hungary during the years that followed the restoration of dictatorship after the suppression of the anti-Stalinist uprising in October–November 1956. János Kádár’s government, which had been established only by the military might of the Soviet Union, attempted to obtain legitimacy on the basis of a curious historical argument. Meanwhile, the new Communist leadership justified the suppression of democratic and independent aspirations by claiming to protect Hungarians against the peril of counterrevolution. It built the image of October 1956 on its alleged historical</p>

                     <p>On 21 March 1949, the Hungarian Federation of Freedom Fighters – a Communist partisan organization which allegedly consisted of wartime anti-Nazi resistance fighters, but which was mostly a fiction to convince Hungarians of the existence of an indigenous Communist resistance movement – organized a bicycle and motorbike race around blocks of flats in Budapest. The competition was part of a set of ceremonies commemorating the proclamation of the First Hungarian Soviet Republic on 21 March 1919. The director of the Institute for Party History, László Réti, justified its appropriateness as follows: ‘We have to take care of, and improve the spirit of,</p>

                     <p>Having succeeded the suppression of the revolution in October 1956, the first time that the new Communist regime evoked the events of 1919 was likely in the 21 November issue of the<italic>Népszabadság</italic>(People’s freedom), the party’s official daily. That day the editors published a letter, which had allegedly been sent to the government by an old worker. The author of this letter first gives an account of his life spent within the labour movement since 1917. The worker writes about his sufferings and privation during the previous regime, then recalls the happy years following the end of the war.</p>

                     <p>For many decades, the Pantheon of the Labour Movement situated in the Kerepesi Cemetery of Budapest was regarded by the then ruling Hungarian Communist Party as one of its principal commemorative constructions. Nowadays, the building stands abandoned. On the one hand, while the era of the Communist politics of history seems to be over forever, this is precisely why the monument’s megalomaniac attempt to reinterpret the national past may seem familiar to us. On the other hand, this monumentality is exactly what renders the story of the pantheon distant and unfamiliar: what could be the origins of this obsession towards</p>
