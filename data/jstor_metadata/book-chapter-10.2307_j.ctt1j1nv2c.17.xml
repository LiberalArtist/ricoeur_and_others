      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In the second volume of a series that will ultimately include four, the authors consider Irish diasporic memory and memory practices. While the Irish diaspora has become the subject of a wide range of scholar­ship, there has been little work focused on its relationship to memory. The first half of the volume asks how diasporic memory functions in dif­ferent places and times, and what forms it takes on. As an island nation with a history of emigration, Ireland has developed a rich diasporic cultural memory, one that draws on multiple traditions and his­toriographies of both "home" and "away." Native traditions are not imported wholesale, but instead develop their own curious hybridity, reflecting the nature of emigrant memory that absorbs new ways of thinking about home. How do immigrants remember their homeland? How do descendants of immigrants "remem­ber" a land they rarely visit? How does diasporic memory pass through families, and how is it represented in cultural forms such as literature, festivals, and souvenirs?</p>

                     <p>A striking aspect of Irish studies has been its success beyond Ireland’s geographical boundaries. Indeed, much of the initial impetus for Irish studies as a field seemed to come from outside of Ireland, and it is now usual to hear of Irish studies not only at an array of Irish and American universities, not only in English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but also in places where it might seem more unexpected: in Japan, Brazil, France. Part of the attraction of Irish studies is undoubtedly the list of world-class Irish writers on whom thousands of theses and</p>

                     <p>In 2004, Clint Eastwood’s film<italic>Million Dollar Baby</italic>became the latest in a line of Hollywood movies to present Irishness as a metaphor for home, belonging, and connectedness—all the values perceived to be missing in an early-twenty-first-century world dominated by the homogenizing force of global capitalism. Eastwood’s film is based on a short story, “Rope Burns,” by the Irish-American writer F. X. Toole, and concerns the surrogate father-daughter relationship between poverty-stricken waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and Frankie Dunne (Clint Eastwood), a disillusioned boxing coach. Their names might indicate an ancestral link to Ireland, but their current condition is</p>

For these authors, memories of Ireland are maintained and promulgated through ancestry, which, as both a personal and communal phenomenon, is a definitive manifestation of cultural memory. Indeed, ancestry can be seen as an example of a<italic>lieu de memoire,</italic>in Pierre Nora’s terminology, because of the coexistence of</p>

A young man beleaguered by the jibes of local wits in attendance had attempted, in a somewhat Arnoldian manner, to establish and discuss the Indo-European origins of the Irish race. The lecture gave a couple of Mr. Dooley’s patrons pause to reconsider their own native origins: “I make no doubt it’s thrue,” says</p>

                     <p>Early in 2008, when Barack Obama’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States began to look like it might succeed, some Irish people began to claim him as their own, tracing his maternal roots to a great-great-grandfather born in Moneygall, County Offaly. Soon after, the Limerick-based Corrigan Brothers (then recording under the name Hardy Drew and the Nancy Boys) released a song and video, “There’s No One as Irish as Barack Obama,” which in its various manifestations was viewed by more than a million people on YouTube before Obama’s 2009 inauguration and covered by an Irish-American</p>

                     <p>Since the mid–nineteenth century at least, Ireland has appeared in American culture somewhat as it does on “The Surrealist Map of the World”—larger than life and severely distorted. Most imported Irish cultural elements have, historically, been systematically mediated through mass cultural forms; that is, they have entered into American consciousness as artifacts of commodity culture. That this has been occurring for at least 150 years is clear from recent research into the tourism industry in Ireland, which has been promoting itself actively since the end of the Great Famine. Less researched, however, is what lies behind or motivates</p>

                     <p>In 1850, Waterhouse &amp; Co., Jewelers of Dame Street, Dublin, acquired a fabulous golden brooch that had recently washed up on a Drogheda beach, like a message in a bottle from the ancient Irish past (Whitfield 1976, 106). Made of gilt silver, the brooch’s surfaces were decorated with gold granulation, filigree interlace designs, champlevé enamel bosses, and imported gemstones. Only 8.7 centimeters in diameter, its fine decoration was suited to the contemporary taste for elaborate pattern. The beautiful and mysterious object was dated to the early medieval period and nicknamed the “Tara Brooch” to evoke a connection with the Iron</p>

Not only were such familiar national symbols still valued, they were also necessary, concluded the reporter, to maintain a good spirit among colonists.

                     <p>There is a huge Before and After in the middle of my childhood that has to do with two different countries, England and Ireland. This is not so unusual, as such. Many children move about internationally with their parents, but in my mind, for my life, it has a defining, irrevocable quality: Before Kerry and After Kerry. Being fostered out to my Aunt May in Cahiratrant in West Kerry is the watershed, and everything falls into place around that occurrence, which happened when I was five years old.</p>

                     <p>Cultural memory, as the project<italic>Memory Ireland</italic>demonstrates, has an array of milieus. Irish cultural memory can be located at heritage sites, embodied by memorials and museums, found in landscapes inscribed with place names that have changed over time. Cultural memory is also located, though, in cultural forms that remain unattached to a geographical space. Instead, such cultural forms function as containers of specific indexes of memory and reflect a range of what I term “memory practices,” which are ways of cultural remembering that result from and are shaped by particular cultural forms. Many of these cultural forms embody memory</p>

                     <p>Ireland, with its reputation as the “Land of Song,” is the only country in the world to have a musical instrument as its national symbol. It is thus not surprising that music is so intimately involved in the collective remembering of events in Irish history. When in the eighteenth century a decline in the numbers of Irish speakers occurred, the Irish language could no longer serve to transmit cultural memory as it once had; during this period, music became central to national expression. Charles Hamilton Teeling, a member of the United Irishmen, noted that throughout the time surrounding the 1798</p>

                     <p>“Sound,” the American composer Morton Feldman wrote, “does not know its history” (2000, 22). Feldman’s statement captures a particularly modernist approach to the material aspect of art: in the case of music, sound is to be encountered as a thing in itself, without any immediate connection to exterior meaning or reality. The desire for the experience of pure artistic form implies its converse, also desired, in which art is experienced as an object in time, linked to tradition and occasion. To set these two aspects of artistic experience against one another is the hallmark of the modern sensibility. Modernity, as</p>

                     <p>It has been noted that “the language of memory does seem to be above all a language of images” (Kuhn 2000, 188). Susan Sontag argues that photography’s preeminence within the “language” of memory stems from the mechanics of how memory operates, in that it “freeze-frames”; its “basic unit is the single image” (2004, 19). If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic</p>

                     <p>That Travellers and other “outsiders” have never felt “at home” in the literature and visual culture of the Irish mainstream is, by now, an acknowledged truism. The long-established quintessential “outsider,” the figure of the Traveller has held a fascination for Irish writers, a fascination that flourished in English from the nineteenth century onward. Writers as well-known and diverse as J. M. Synge, W. B. Yeats, Pádraic Ó Conaire, James Stephens, Liam O’Flaherty, John B. Keane, Bryan MacMahon, Jennifer Johnston, and Richard Murphy have employed Traveller characters and Traveller tropes, the vast majority of which have been made to fit generic</p>

                     <p>“Irish” spaces in the United States are constructions of memory, tradition, and identity that can inhabit both physical and psychic realms. The New York–based<italic>Irish Echo</italic>newspaper, for example, invites readers to “Visit Ireland every week of the year in [its] pages” (3–9 Mar. 2004, 28). Irish cultural festivals around the country deploy identifiable markers of US Irishness (live Irish music, beer, Irish dancing, Irish gifts, genealogy kits) to draw crowds of Irish and other Americans. But Gaelic Park, on the northern edge of New York City, offers a physical, visceral opportunity inaccessible elsewhere. Gaelic Park is an</p>

                     <p>Mary Butler played a small part in the early-twentieth-century crusade to revive authentic Irish culture, as imagined by the nationalist movement. In a pamphlet addressed to the women of Ireland, she crafted a list of fifteen ways that they might foster true Irishness in their homes. “Make the home atmosphere Irish,” she admonished Ireland’s mothers, by making “the social atmosphere Irish.” As wives and mothers, she cajoled, they must insist that children be given Irish names, learn the Irish language in school, listen to Irish music, and enjoy Irish dance as performers and spectators. She based this all on a</p>

                     <p>The traditional Irish cottage is an enduring icon that represents varieties of Irishness to varieties of observers. The subject of poems and travelogues, postcards and photographs, it has been monumentalized in such commemorations as the Hunger Memorial in New York City, used as a signature for Irish pubs in the United States and elsewhere, and kitsched up in the creation of countless souvenirs. As a prime symbol of the Emerald Isle, the humble cottage belongs to the same heavy-lifting category as the much-maligned, yet (by many) much–beloved shamrock.</p>

The rum wasn’t meant for drinking, needless to say, since our house was an alcohol-free zone. It was meant for the Christmas cake my mother made each year—a cake that, perversely, consisted almost entirely of raisins, currants, and sultanas soaked in rum.</p>
                     <p>My annual foray into the Eagle Bar often took place on a frosty, mistshrouded morning. I’d long since come to associate the frost and mist with</p>
