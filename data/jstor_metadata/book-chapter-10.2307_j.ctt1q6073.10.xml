      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Highlighting the wide variety of ethical concerns considered by writers such as Timothy Findley, Thomas King, Carol Shields, Julian Barnes, A.S. Byatt, and Salman Rushdie, Deborah Bowen makes the case for a new category of "postmodern realism" and shows how contemporary stories about "the real" and "the good" are constructed. Applying theoretical insights from Emmanuel Levinas and Mikhail Bakhtin, Bowen investigates categories of postmodern realism such as magic realism, parody, and metafiction while laying the groundwork for Christian readings of a medium that is often perceived as largely irreligious. An illuminating study of well-known contemporary writers, Stories of the Middle Space is a critically nuanced and methodologically innovative work that reads the postmodern from a faith-based perspectives to create new literary insights.</p>

                     <p>I sit in my study, looking out of the window into the huge maple tree in the front yard. The leaves, jostling against winged russet and lime-green seedpods, have that slightly dusty, used look which presages their decline and fall. The white sky glimmers behind them. They move constantly in a light August breeze.</p>
                     <p>Or is it that they move inconstantly? Is the sky perhaps blank, rather than glimmering – or both? And might the dusty look of the leaves imply a narrative other than one that anticipates their imminent end? How do I describe this tree, for which words are</p>

                     <p>Lazing on the deck in the hazy warmth of a late afternoon in August, I had been idly flicking through the pages of our city’s monthly glossy magazine, a publication which depends heavily on upmarket advertising and is “mailed to selected homes” in our area. Sandwiched between a piece about customized tailoring and a full spread heralding a new townhomes complex, and interrupted by a section called “Body and Soul: Your Better Health and Wellness Guide” (“Learn to live in the present,” “Get into rhythm with nature,” “Become a child again,” etc., etc.), thirteen whole pages had been given over</p>

                     <p>In “Sugar,” a short story first published in the<italic>New Yorker</italic>in 1987, the British novelist A.S. Byatt engages with questions of storytelling, memory, and truthfulness. Byatt’s narrator, faced with the terminal illness of her father, finds herself considering how family history is transmitted: the ways in which such transmission is affected by the time and place of narration, the state of mind of the narrator, and the purposes of the storytelling itself. Her father has always been a taciturn man, but in his final illness becomes a storyteller, seeming to want to fill in gaps and set records straight</p>

The presence of nonrational, magical elements in an otherwise apparently realistic, rational world serves as a rejection of the overwhelmingly scientific, rational approach to life which has been characterized as the dominant Western post-Enlightenment view (Harrison,<italic>Rushdie</italic>55). Rushdie himself, interviewed in 1985, made very clear why he considered a turn away from</p>

                     <p>Fiction that plays seriously with reality is likely in particular to consider how received interpretive frames can themselves be reinterpreted. And of course such frames are often themselves stories. There is, then, a significant area of overlap between certain kinds of magic realist fiction and fictions which unsettle those traditional founding stories that we call myth. One novel that could be described both as magic realism and as a parodic version of myth is Thomas King’s<italic>Green Grass, Running Water</italic>(1993), a subversive rewriting of the biblical metanarrative from a Native American perspective.</p>

                     <p>Thus far in this exploration of the fictions of postmodern realism we have considered three oxymoronic categories of the “middle space”: historiographic metafiction, magic realism, and parodic myth. We have seen how each in its palimpsestic boundary-crossings offers specific culturally sensitive possibilities for narrative-as-ethics. Now, in this chapter, I want to look at a particular non-verbal form of storytelling, and that is photography. I am going to argue that, because photographs are both dependent on the givenness of the physical world and yet at the same time manifestly constructed, they can be read as paradigmatic of postmodern realism.

                     <p>Though A.S. Byatt dismisses Christian faith as a viable personal option, it is no surprise that as a literary critic and a writer she has a profound appreciation of the foundational nature of the Christian tradition for Western literature and art. She understands Christian stories and symbols as fictional but still powerful. When she writes in her key essay on Van Gogh that we all make sense out of our life experiences by using the myths and fictions of our ancestors, she adds that “we play, in a sense, with so few essentials, since the myths became defined as fictions”</p>
