         <p>Mothering Mennonite marks the first scholarly attempt to incorporate religious groundings in interpretations of motherhood. The essays included here broaden our understanding of maternal identity as something not only constructed within the family and by society at large, but also influenced significantly by historical traditions and contemporary belief systems of religious communities. A multidisciplinary compilation of essays, this volume joins narrative and scholarly voices to address both the roles of mothering in Mennonite contexts and the ways in which Mennonite mothering intersects with and is shaped by the world at large. Contributors address cultural constructions of motherhood within ethnoreligious Mennonite communities, examining mother-daughter relationships and intergenerational influences, analyzing visual and literary representations of Mennonite mothers, challenging cultural constructions and expectations of motherhood, and tracing the effects of specific religious and cultural contexts on mothering in North and South America.’Mothering Mennonite marks the first scholarly attempt to incorporate religious groundings in interpretations of motherhood.

I begin with what is a constant in writing about photography, namely our assumption that a photograph is evidence, in the words of Susan Sontag, “that something exists, or did exist…” (<italic>5</italic>). Unlike a painting, a photograph is proof “that<italic>they were there</italic>” and, as Roland Barthes notes, it cannot escape this “pure deictic language.” My opening gesture, then, is like that of “the child pointing his finger at something</p>

                     <p>My first reading of Darcie Friesen Hossack’s superbly written<italic>Mennonites</italic>Don’t<italic>Dance</italic>did not evoke any wish to dance. In fact, I needed long breaks between stories, sometimes within stories, just to ease the emotional upheaval of seeing and feeling again so much of what I have often willed into invisibility. While all fiction requires of us some emotional involvement in the characters’ lives, Hossack’s short stories “identify me to myself”¹ as if her fictional mothers are my mother and her fictional daughters are my sister and I. When identification is that strong, it seems foolish and cowardly to refuse</p>

In the farm kitchen with its yellow curtains, Jason’s mother Elaine washes the dishes after every meal so there’s plenty of counter space.

                     <p>In many ways, my mother was a non-conformist. In the late 1940s in Morden, Manitoba, when most Mennonite women her age were getting married, she was away from home teaching school in remote northern Manitoba communities. When these same women were having babies, she was pursuing a theological degree from Mennonite Brethren Bible College (mbbc) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She did eventually get married at the ripe old age of twenty-five. And she did have children, a respectable half dozen to be exact. But she never really did follow the gendered conventions of her time. She died in August of 2010</p>

In my poems I bear witness to, and illuminate my history as a shaping influence of my own experience as a mother, conveyed in the voice of the poems’ speaker. “I am from Many Places,” “Home is in the Evening Shade of a Low Mountain,” “My Grandmother’s Strong Name,” “Telegram, 1943,” “Memory is a Taste in my Mouth,”</p>

                     <p>Following the annual extended Stoesz family dinner last Christmas, in a wood-framed house, tucked quietly away on an expansive treed property in Manitoba’s beautiful Pembina Valley, I watched as my mother-in-law, Violet Stoesz, her sister, Yvonne Stoesz, and their mother, Sara Unger Stoesz, cleared the long table together. The three women moved comfortably and efficiently between table and kitchen, their shuffling gaits and melodic laughter matching one another almost perfectly. They worked quietly in step with Yvonne’s humming, lifting plates above our heads, skirting the flow of relatives moving in and out of the kitchen, and dodging the young ones’</p>

                     <p>Motherhood is an identity common to women in all societies, but the expression of it varies greatly both within and across social groups. Mothering emerges from the intersection of a woman’s personality, her life experiences, and choices available to her, and is embedded in gender role expectations shaped by religion, culture, and historical context. Every woman constructs her own expression of motherhood through a process of accepting and resisting role expectations. The process of establishing individual motherhood priorities may be covert or overt—likely influenced by the consequences of the choices. Thus the social construction of motherhood is dynamic and</p>

                     <p>It would be fair to ask why a researcher who is neither a Mennonite nor a mother would be interested in the topic of Old Colony Mennonite¹ mothering, and what she could contribute to the discussion. In this essay, I write from the privileged position of an educated white woman who is known within the community where I live and work as someone who holds a position of authority and trust within the education sector. As a school principal, I have interacted extensively with Old Colony Mennonite children and their families. My vantage point as an “Outsider” provides a unique</p>

                     <p>“How old are you?” “Are you married?” “Do you have children?” These are the questions I was often asked when I first visited conservative Mennonite families in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in July 1999. At the time, I was a graduate student at a Japanese university researching tourism in Lancaster. I was a little perplexed in hearing the same questions over and over again, but I explained that I was in my mid-twenties, single without children, and had no relatives in the United States. I answered their questions as accurately as I could, but in part because of my limited English,</p>

Other days, I’m convinced it’s simply part of my alternative vocation. This essay reflects my inner tug of war about becoming a biological mother. My ongoing story asks to be</p>

                     <p>The ideology of scientific motherhood began to gain ground in Canada in the late nineteenth century, and came to rationalize mothering for Mennonite women along expert and scientific lines. Scientific motherhood was a widespread cultural movement that sought to reproduce the conditions of industrialization and regulate the modes of women’s labour inside the “factory” home. Scientific motherhood is closely associated with urbanization, industrialization, the medicalization of childbirth, and the increasing popularity of artificial formula that characterized its rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see Apple), a time of significant Mennonite resettlement in Canada. For Canadian mothers, including</p>

Yet, Beachy Amish-Mennonites have sought to retain Amish characteristics, including an emphasis on lifelong redemption through separatist community life, defined gender roles, and distinct practices. This hybridization of evangelical and Old Order reorganized their society in nuanced ways, including how women contributed to community and family formation. Among the Amish, women are responsible for having and raising children, that is, perpetuating</p>

                     <p>A common assumption concerning childhood play in societies with well-entrenched gender roles and conservative religious values is that imaginative play is discouraged and that play simply replicates anticipated “real-life roles” (Carlson, Taylor, and Levin 538; Taylor and Carlson 257). However, scholars of cross-cultural research on childhood, and particularly on childhood play, argue that children’s play is more independent of pragmatic expectations and adult supervision than often assumed (Aguilar 29-30, 37; Edwards 335-7; Rabain-Jamin, Maynard, and Greenfield 204-5; Watson-Gegeo 148; McMahon and Sutton-Smith 297-8), since children’s symbolic behaviour is not necessarily compliant, but at times even subversive, defying cultural expectations (Ackerley</p>

                     <p>In colombia, there is an adjective used to describe motherly love:<italic>amor entrañable</italic>. The literal translation of<italic>entrañable</italic>as “close/intimate” does not completely describe the intent of the word in Spanish, which implies love that is strong, protective, nurturing, and instinctual (Paul Stucky). The Mennonite church in Teusaquillo, Bogotá has created a space for victims of political violence, which serves as a protective womb, where victims enter vulnerable and desperate and find hope, generosity, and a commitment to peace and justice. The response to this<italic>amor entreñable</italic>is reciprocal and restorative. The repetitions of giving and receiving, grieving and celebrating</p>
