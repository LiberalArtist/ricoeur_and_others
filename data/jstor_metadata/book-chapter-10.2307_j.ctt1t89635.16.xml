         <p>Researching the Lifecourse features methods linking time, space and mobilities and provides practitioners with practical detail in each chapter. It covers the full lifecourse and includes innovative methods and case study examples from different European and North American contexts.The lifecourse perspective continues to be an important subject in the social sciences. Researching the Lifecourse offers a distinctive approach in that it truly covers the lifecourse (childhood, adulthood and older age), focusing on innovative methods and case study examples from a variety of European and North American contexts. This original approach connects theory and practice from across the social sciences by situating methodology and research design within relevant conceptual frameworks. This diverse collection features methods that are linked to questions of time, space and mobilities while providing practitioners with practical detail in each chapter.</p>

                     <p>Lifecourse research is undertaken by researchers from across the social sciences, often working in a multidisciplinary context, using the lifecourse as an underpinning concept and/or a method of study. In this book we aim to represent the diversity of lifecourse methodologies employed in the social sciences, as well as having a concern for epistemology – how different knowledge claims are connected to our research practices. Moreover, the contributors in this edited book emphasise how different theoretical frameworks and positionality affect the research process – each contributor examines the challenges of their research design and how they worked through methodological issues</p>

                     <p>For groups, as well as for individuals, life itself means to separate and to be re-united, to change form and condition, to die and to be reborn. It is to act and to cease, to wait and rest, and then to begin acting again but in a different way. And there are always new thresholds to cross… (van Gennep, 1960 [1909], p 189)</p>
                     <p>This quotation from an early ‘armchair’ anthropologist reflects much of what is compelling about the study of the lifecourse – conceptualised here as the flow of lives through time. Writing in the first decade of the 20th</p>

                     <p>The lifecourse can be studied using a number of different research designs and methodological approaches – all presenting their own set of challenges and benefits. In recent years there has been increasing use of the lifegrid for both quantitative and qualitative studies. The application of the lifegrid is appealing to many researchers for a variety of reasons. It is especially useful for studies where a longitudinal focus is integral to the research objective(s), and such is the case with lifecourse research. Compared with traditional longitudinal studies, the administration of the lifegrid is a less costly alternative and is relatively easy</p>

                     <p>Mapmaking can be a process by which individuals orient themselves and navigate from place to place. The process of mapmaking can also be used as a tool for understanding one’s sense of place. The mapmaking experience is rooted in what Sobel (1998, p 5) identifies as ‘our visual, kinesthetic, and emotional experiences’. As a visual method, mapmaking provides one example of how individuals engage with place. Individuals throughout the lifecourse – from young children to ageing adults – influence and are influenced by place. And in order to better understand individuals’ experience with place, research methodologies have increasingly turned to</p>

                     <p>This chapter is about a research project on the friendship afforded to women in their fifties by members of their ‘personal communities’ and their interactions with information and communication technologies (ICT). The research examined the informal social interactions of women in ‘midlife’ in the context of their lifecourse trajectory to date and their anticipations of the future. It focused, in particular, on the time–space context of these interactions, exploring the time–space scheduling of ‘keeping in touch’ and the real and virtual spaces within which these social interactions took place. The empirical research was carried out in the summer</p>

                     <p>In this chapter I focus on the possibilities that embodied knowledge opens up when undertaking research on the lifecourse. Shotter (2009) argues that social theorists often overlook embodied knowledge as they evaluate human action through causes (emphasising structures) or reasons (emphasising agency). In my work on ‘geobiographies’ I connect the highly contextual and unique with lifecourse information, specifically relating current everyday life (especially outdoor activities) with the habitualities developed over a participant’s lifecourse. I examine embodied knowledge as a joint outcome of the lifecourse and its geographical context – space and place. In this chapter I use geo-coordinates as a</p>

                     <p>Since early the 2000s, the number of long-term immigrants to New Zealand deciding to return to their homelands has increased. Simultaneously, Korea has made changes to its residency policy in an attempt to attract ‘global talent’ back to its shores. The result has been an increase in the number of overseas Koreans returning from their emigration destinations. The processes driving this movement and the experience(s) of returnees on resettlement have received little attention in research.</p>

                     <p>The study of spatial mobility in European social sciences suffers from institutional and thematic segmentation (daily mobility, tourism, residential mobility, migration). However, a growing number of studies have shown that a comprehensive, linked approach to mobility is an effective way of capturing hybrid practices that fall between residential and daily mobility (such as multiple residences and long-distance commuting: Dupont and Dureau, 1994; Lévy and Dureau, 2002; Kaufmann and Vincent-Geslin, 2012). This approach can be used to focus more on the multi-local dimension of individuals’ spatial practices across the lifecourse. Living in more than one place at once is a topic</p>

                     <p>Understanding why people decide to move is a complicated enterprise (Bertaux-Wiame, 1979; Ni Laoire, 2000). Although migration may be a straightforward demographic event, the context in which it occurs and the mechanisms underlying it are often highly complex, and require careful study. To begin with, it is important to consider the individual role of the migrant. To what extent do people move freely from one place to another, and to what extent are their movements impacted by structural forces and constraints? Traditional models used for understanding migration decision making have typically emphasised<italic>either</italic>agency<italic>or</italic>structure but seldom both; moreover,</p>
