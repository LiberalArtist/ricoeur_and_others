         <p>The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.</p>

                     <p>In 1968 worldwide revolutionary agitation was greater than at any time since the end of World War I. From Paris to Peking, governments were forced to deal with varieties of unrest. The global revolts of 1968 seemed to constitute an international revolutionary wave comparable to the Atlantic Revolutions at the end of the eighteenth century or to the continental European revolutions of 1848. As in 1789 and 1848, Paris was once again a center of revolt. Although this time Paris did not initiate the movement (German, Italian, and American upheavals preceded it), the French capital became the first major theater</p>

                     <p>The radical students who started the chain of events that led to the greatest strike wave in French history lashed out against capitalism, the state, and property. They extended their protests to what they considered the pleasure-denying restraints of bourgeois society and desired “to liberate man from all the repressions of social life.”¹ Repression meant not just police but a wide spectrum of social activities—wage labor, sexual restraint, industrial hierarchy, and academic discipline. As in other Western nations, universities became the launching pad of their assaults. The most liberal institution provided cover for adversaries of the dominant social/political order</p>

                     <p>Contrary to Francis Fukuyama’s denigration of the Paris students of 1968 as “pampered offspring,” lacking any “rational reason to rebel,” they had real educational grievances.¹ Compared with other nations, the French universities were considerably overenrolled. In 1967 the number of students was between 700,000 and 750,000; whereas in Great Britain and also in Germany, whose economy was larger than the French, enrollment was between 300,000 and 350,000.² Moreover, there was a much less satisfactory instructor per student ratio in France than in other major Western European nations with the exception of Italy. Great Britain and Germany had, compared with France,</p>

Even though Parisian universities contained the largest proportion of students of bourgeois origin, Parisian students—who constituted approximately one-fourth of the French total—were more leftist and more inclined to join<italic>groupuscules</italic>or the UNEF than their provincial counterparts.² Seventy-nine percent of Parisian students in humanities considered themselves on the left, compared to 56 percent of provincial humanities students.</p>

                     <p>Wage earners took advantage of the momentary weakness of state power in the middle of May to initiate the largest strike wave in French history. The fact that student radicals looked to workers to make the revolution was less important in sparking strikes than the divisions among political elites. What has been called the “political opportunity structure” encouraged the extension of the unrest to wage earners.¹ Even some members of the Gaullist majority wavered in support for the government. As in 1789, 1848, and 1871, cleavages within ruling groups promoted popular revolt. Both student and worker actions were parts of</p>

                     <p>After the revolts of May and June, Marxists and anarchists of various stripes continued to believe that agitation would persist and that the working class was on the road to revolution.¹ Radicals, confident of their dynamism and bolstered by the youthful demographic bulge, were hopeful about the future. Like their counterparts throughout the world, they felt that morality and history were on their side. Revolutionary artists reflected this sentiment in posters, such as “May 68: The Beginning of a Long Struggle” (see figure 15). Several books published at the end of 1968 carried the title<italic>It Is Only a Beginning</italic>.</p>
