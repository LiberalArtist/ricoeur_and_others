                     <p>The German philosopher Josef pieper (1904–1997) continues to provoke among his contemporaries constructive, critical, and especially fruitful discussion on anthropological and ethical questions. He does this by formulating a defense of culture, which he contrasts with a pragmatic way of thinking that reduces the person to a specific role and function, to proletarian status. His thought is expressed in a lively style unfettered by any jargon or technical terminology—in contrast with much scholarly writing coming out of today’s universities. Such a use of language accompanied by the originality of his thought earned him the praises of the</p>

                     <p>Josef pieper belongs to that small class of modern philosophers who took the political and moral catastrophe of the past century as a challenge for their own thought and action. Although until now his work has left only a few traces in the theoretical discourse of academic circles, its effect on the life and thought of countless students and readers has been much greater.¹ While Pieper rather extensively described the historical context of his career in his autobiographical works, he let fall only a few hints here and there about the more technical philosophical context of his writing.² The following</p>

One of his teachers at the <italic>Gymnasium Paulinum</italic> nudged him in a different direction, explaining that the “black bread” of Thomas Aquinas is more nourishing than the Dane’s “pastries.” Pieper took the advice, and picked up the prologue to Aquinas’s commentary on the Gospel of John.²</p>

                     <p>Perhaps no alteration in the landscape of Anglo-American philosophy in the last thirty years has been more surprising, more sustained, and more fruitful than the resurgence of interest in the ethics of virtue. Most discussions of the history of twentieth-century moral philosophy trace the return of virtue to Elizabeth Anscombe’s essay from the late 1950s, “Modern moral philosophy.”¹ A jeremiad against Kantian and utilitarian ethical theories, Anscombe’s essay urged that, given the present state of philosophical ethics—with its incoherent conceptions of obligation, its lack both of terminological clarity and of an adequate philosophical psychology—we should banish ethics totally</p>

                     <p>Together with Aristotle, Augustine, and Thomas, Plato is for Josef Pieper one of the four greatest Western thinkers. Reference to the Athenian philosopher becomes more frequent in his mature works. Whereas in his first four volumes on the virtues—which date from 1934 through 1939 and are mainly conceived as a philosophical actualization of Aquinas’s thought—Plato is not quoted,¹ the other three—dating from the fifties, sixties, and seventies—show an increasing assimilation of basic Platonic theses.² This constitutes an important enrichment in Pieper’s philosophical itinerary. Without abandoning Thomas, Pieper sees in Plato a source of insights for illuminating</p>
