      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism. The book will appeal to both those actively involved in religious negotiation and to scholars and students of religion in history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and political science.</p>

                     <p>The social costs of increasing antagonism, fear and social dislocation on the basis of religious persuasion suggest that Australia, as well as other multicultural societies, needs to re-examine the place of religion in society, the causes of social discontent, as well as the various means by which religious differences may be negotiated peaceably. Such an examination requires information from a wide variety of perspectives, and discussion at all levels of society. The purpose of this volume is to make a contribution to this discussion by providing a rich, multifaceted exploration of the issue. It brings together religious and secular perspectives</p>

                     <p>Until quite recently there appeared to be a consensus in Western democracies as to the desirability of abolishing the offence of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. Indeed, in 1949, Lord Denning argued that â€²the offence of blasphemy is a dead letterâ€². According to Lord Denning, the basis of the law against blasphemy was the idea that â€²a denial of Christianity was liable to shake the fabric of society, which was itself founded upon the Christian religionâ€², a danger that no longer existed.Â¹ A long series of judicial remarks and government reports, most recently by the House of Lords Select Committee on</p>

                     <p>The term sacred tends to be used interchangeably with a wide variety of terms: terms like mystical, religious, divine, magical, and, most commonly, spiritual and religious. In 2002, the Humanities Research Centre at The Australian National University ran a conference entitled â€²Locations of Spirituality: â€³Experiencesâ€³ and â€³Writingsâ€³ of the â€³Sacredâ€³â€². All of these topics were addressed in the papers presented at the conference. On one level this suggests that the term â€²sacredâ€² is inherently vague.</p>

These ambiguities are highlighted by considering the contemporary transformation of Tibetan Buddhist ritual objects into Western art objects.

I will be adopting an historical-anthropological approach, with a view to making this discussion of sacrilege comparable with those of people working in other religious and cultural settings. Moreover, there is an important sense in which the societies of early modern Western Europe were themselves multicultural, not just because most contained diverse ethnic â€²nationsâ€², but more importantly because they contained mutually hostile religious communities. In fact, â€²religious cleansingâ€² in early modern Europe provided the prototype for later</p>

                     <p>Until recently a widely held view in sociology was that the conditions of modernity inevitably lead to the secularisation of society. It was further argued that in a secular society, religion becomes increasingly a private concern of the individual and thus loses much of its public relevance and influence. The conditions of modernity were seen as conducive to promoting religious pluralism in which people were voluntary adherents to a plurality of religions, none of which could claim a position of hegemony in society. These and similar views appeared in the works of a number of prominent scholars including Talcott Parsons,Â¹</p>
