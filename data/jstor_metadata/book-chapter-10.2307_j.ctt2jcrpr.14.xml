      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.</p>

                     <p>Over the last decade there has been a significant shift in the attitudes of philosophers as they have become increasingly receptive to the opportunity to apply methods of philosophical inquiry to film, television, and other areas of popular culture. In fact,<italic>receptive</italic>is far too mild a word to describe the enthusiasm with which many philosophers now embrace popular culture. The authors of the essays included in this volume have genuine affection for science fiction feature films and the expertise to describe, explain, analyze, and evaluate the story lines, conflicts, and philosophically salient themes in them. Their contributions are designed</p>

                     <p>To all appearances,<italic>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</italic>(Don Siegel, 1956) is a paean to individuality and a warning of its imminent loss. Human-size pods appear in the California town of Santa Mira and begin duplicating the bodies of the residents, absorbing their minds while they sleep. Rushing into action with his growing realization that Santa Mira is being taken over by the pods, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) shows a resilient defiance in his perseverance against all odds. Evidently, we are meant to understand what it means to believe in something and fight for a cause.</p>

                     <p>Robert Wiseโs 1951 movie<italic>The Day the Earth Stood Still</italic>is generally regarded as a classic of science fiction film. At least as a working definition of the genre, I take science fiction to be that branch of literature (and by extension films) that deals with the effects of science or technology on the human condition or that explores the human condition via science. This can include utopian or dystopian future societies, of course, but<italic>The Day the Earth Stood Still</italic>is set in early 1950s America.</p>

                     <p>Suppose you had a time machine. Where exactly would you like to go throughout all the possibilities of temporal locations? Would you want to go back to the Jurassic period to learn more about the dinosaurs? Maybe you would like to go back to ancient Greece to finally know whether or not the Battle of Troy really took place. Perhaps the past bores you, and youโre really a future adventurer instead. If so, would you fast-forward to 3050 to see if human beings are riding in flying cars and living on the moon? Maybe youโd like to go even further,</p>

                     <p>In<italic>2001: A Space Odyssey</italic>(1968) we are invited by director Stanley Kubrick to experience a mesmerizing yet also alienating form of sensory liberation, as paradoxical as such an experience may at first sound. His landmark science fiction film does not attempt to free us somehow from our five senses, certainly. In fact, the film tends to enhance an appreciation of our perceptual faculties, particularly those of vision and hearing, as well as to encourage reflection on what we have experienced through our senses while watching the film. But Kubrickโs masterwork leads us beyond the borders of our conventional world</p>

                     <p>Some of the most vividly unnerving scenes in<italic>The Terminator</italic>(James Cameron, 1984) are those that present the Terminatorโs point of view, giving us a sense of what it would be like to be the Terminator, to see the world as it does, to have not only artificial intelligence but also, more disturbingly, artificial consciousness. The judicious use of the subjective camera is an especially effective technique when appropriately modified to evoke alien perspectives, those radically unlike our own. The Terminatorโs visual field is infrared, with heads-up displays for attentional shift and focus, information processing of different kinds, decision-making menus,</p>

                     <p>For anyone living in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, science fiction cinema is one of the few art forms that attempt to predict the future of human nature and civilizationโa future filled with space travel, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and widespread surveillance. Ridley Scottโs<italic>Blade Runner</italic>(1982) and<italic>Alien</italic>(1979), George Lucasโs<italic>Star Wars</italic>sextology (1977โ2005), the Wachowski brothersโ<italic>The Matrix</italic>(1999), and Stanley Kubrickโs<italic>Dr. Strangelove</italic>(1963) and<italic>A Clockwork Orange</italic>(1971) are among the most influential science fiction films. None of them, however, can be properly understood without an initial grasp of Fritz Langโs early</p>

                     <p>A defining feature of science fiction is that such works of imaginative realism (a potent stylistic brew of perhaps irreconcilable elements) speculate about some future age or alternative, extraterrestrial world. That imagined place and time is characterized essentially by โadvancementsโ in science that plausibly explore the consequences of what is now known and actively researched (in such areas as artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, space travel, pharmacology, and so forth). The difference between the readerโs implied present and the postulated alternative results from the technological manipulation of the natural environment and human experience that such acquired knowledge makes possible.</p>

                     <p>Jean-Luc Godardโs<italic>Alphaville, une รฉtrange aventure de Lemmy Caution</italic>(1965) appears on first viewing to be a typical variation of a classic science fiction film in which humanity has been invaded and is threatened with complete colonization by an alien forceโin this case an alien computer, Alpha 60, which rules in the name of scientific logic. Indeed, Godardโs film even features a deranged scientist-villain, Leonard Von Braun (Howard Vernon), as the chief human agent of this alien colonization who has himself been converted into the apparently perfect scientific-technocratic man without a trace of human emotion. However, the deeper theme</p>

                     <p>Thomas Anderson, computer programmer and hacker, learns that everything he thought he knew about the world and his life is false, that heโs been deceived. Further, he discovers that he and most of his fellow human beings are enslaved in a way that he never could have imagined and that he is the chosen One, the savior who will lead them out of the slavery of ignorance and to enlightenment and understanding. Interestingly, Renรฉ Descartes asks us to imagine a similar all-encompassing deception, and Plato famously writes in the<italic>Republic</italic>about just such an escape from bondage and a journey</p>
