                     <p>This volume is a record of the proceedings of the ninth Building Bridges seminar for Christian and Muslim scholars, convened by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan Williams, and held at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, from May 25–27, 2010. The focus of this seminar on Christian and Muslim approaches to the relationship between tradition and modernity was a natural continuation of discussions at earlier Building Bridges seminars, notably on the interface between science and religion in 2009. Following an established pattern, after an opening day of public lectures, the second and third days were spent in private sessions discussing</p>

Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom.

If the first council posited Catholicism’s authoritative answer to the Protestant reformers, the second rightly hails Newman as its “Father.”¹ His influential essay on the development of Christian doctrine put forth a theory that made possible the council’s work of expanding Catholicism’s traditional teachings with fresh insights, precisely in order to perfect their meaning.

                     <p>Is the notion of tradition applicable to all cultural phenomena, both secular and religious? Or is it to be associated especially with religious phenomena? We speak very easily of both cultural and religious traditions, and in general we tend to contrast a “traditioned” mode of life with a “modern” mode of life that is seen as having emanated from the West. “Tradition” as a category then appears to be at once global, ecumenical, and nostalgic. It is seen in contrast to the “modern,” which—though contemporary and now global—is also regarded as parochial because of its specifically European lineage.</p>

All traditions are vulnerable to betrayal for, in the very process of handing on, the original gift may be distorted or even lost. Different traditions no doubt develop different strategies for minimizing the element of betrayal, often centering on the authority to interpret, but these strategies themselves bear witness to the impossibility of reducing the risk of betrayal to zero. Yet the theme of betrayal remains itself ambiguous, for while the guardians or recipients</p>
