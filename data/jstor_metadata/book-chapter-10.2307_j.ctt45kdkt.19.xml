         <p>Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.</p>

                     <p>Memory performed is at the heart of collective memory. When individuals and groups express or embody or interpret or repeat a script about the past, they galvanize the ties that bind groups together and deposit additional memory traces about the past in their own minds. These renewed and revamped memories frequently vary from and overlay earlier memories, creating a complex palimpsest about the past each of us carries with us.</p>
                     <p>Thus the performance of memory is both a mnemonic device and a way in which individual memories are relived, revived, and refashioned. Through performance, we move from the individual to</p>

                     <p>Over the last decade, memory has been acknowledged as a ‘leading concept’ of cultural studies.¹ The number of books and essays that have appeared on the subject already fill whole libraries. The memory discourse is quickly expanding. There is a growing number of different approaches to cultural memory which exist side by side without taking much notice of one another, let alone engage in a discussion of their various underlying axioms and goals. What the memory discourse still lacks is theoretical rigour, an integral as well as differentiated view of the enterprise, and a self-critical investigation of its central concepts.</p>

No historian had predicted the total collapse of the Soviet bloc and the sudden end of the Cold War, the ensuing German unification and the radical reshuffling of global power relations. A similar story goes for the other two ‘epochal’ and ‘rupturing’ events of the past two decades: ‘9/11’ and the economic meltdown of 2008.¹ Therefore, academic historians can claim very little credit for their traditional role as the privileged interpreters of the present</p>

                     <p>This exploration starts from the crossroads where two popular recent approaches to cultural history meet: the study of memory and the study of performance.¹ It may be useful to distinguish at the start of this essay on the performance of memory between different kinds or genres of performance. At one extreme, we find historical plays from Shakespeare to Strindberg and beyond or the historical operas of Verdi, say, or Glinka; in other words, performances that are tightly organized, fully scripted, and carefully rehearsed. At the other extreme, there are loosely organized, unscripted, and unrehearsed attempts to re-enact past events in</p>

                     <p>In 2003 the Staten Island Historical Society (SIHS) in New York mounted a photographic exhibition, ‘Indelible Memories: September 11 Memorial Tattoos’, commemorating the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. The tattoos on display had for the most part been acquired by firefighters and police officers who had been involved in the rescue effort, or by family members of those who had perished when the towers collapsed. The fact that this exhibition took place on Staten Island was not coincidental. The Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, is home to a largely white working-class, Catholic population</p>

Selected pictures would be catalogued by date, place, and type, and labeled with additional information provided by the donors. Some of</p>

As early as the fourth century, Augustine used the example of music to illustrate his meditations on time and memory, describing the process of understanding a melody that unfolds in time,¹ and Edmund Husserl, in his<italic>Untersuchungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewußtseins</italic>, used music as the most obvious example of how memory and expectation or, in his terminology, retention and protention, cooperate in the perceptive construction of a melody.² Perceiving and understanding a melody requires memory, the same kind of short-term memory which</p>

                     <p>Despite poor health foreshadowing his death later that year, Walter Scott spent the spring of 1832 with his son and daughter in Naples. He was fêted by all and sundry, among others by the Austrian minister who organized a masquerade ball in his honour on the theme of the Waverley novels. The invitations to this literary masquerade apparently led to some commotion, Scott’s son Charles describing how ‘one beautiful Italian woman has been in tears for the last week because her family are too Catholic to allow her to take the character of Rebecca the Jewess’.² Refusing a Catholic permission</p>

                     <p>This chapter focuses on literature and the reading act as a nodal point, a relay station, in the dissemination (in space) and transmission (across generations) of cultural memory. In doing so, it draws attention to three interrelated problem areas: 1) the currency of literature is principally shaped by the language of its expression, whereas the currency of memories is principally shaped in societal or political frameworks; 2) the social and political frameworks (i.e. states and institutions) in which cultural memories are current can be less durable and more fluid than the canonicity of certain literary texts; 3) the literary evocation</p>

Among the various instruments of post-Communist transitional justice implemented in the countries of the region, we can distinguish between retributive and reparatory measures. Decommunization and lustration were meant to exclude certain categories of functionaries of the Communist regime from holding important positions in the democratic state, and thus named the perpetrators.

For some this is the inevitable result of a process of integration that is the spill-over effect of economic integration, while for others it is the consequence of the quasisupranational character of the European Union. The current European context is a very interesting case for the study of memory building, both because it is characterized by a complex process of pooling and sharing of sovereignty between nation-states and supranational institutions and because it is a process<italic>in fieri</italic>.
