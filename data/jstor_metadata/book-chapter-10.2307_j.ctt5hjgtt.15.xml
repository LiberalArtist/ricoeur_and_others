      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In this collection of essays, thirty scholars from diverse disciplines offer their unique perspectives on the genius of the King James Version, a translation whose 400th anniversary was recently celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. While avoiding nostalgia and hagiography, each author clearly appreciates the monumental, formative role the KJV has had on religious and civil life on both sides of the Atlantic (and beyond) as well as on the English language itself. In part 1 the essayists look at the KJV in its historical contexts—the politics and rapid language growth of the era, the emerging printing and travel industries, and the way women are depicted in the text (and later feminist responses to such depictions). Part 2 takes a closer look at the KJV as a translation and the powerful precedents it set for all translations to follow, with the essayists exploring the translators’ principles and processes (with close examinations of “Bancroft’s Rules" and the Prefaces), assessing later revisions of the text, and reviewing the translation’s influence on the English language, textual criticism, and the practice of translation in Jewish and Chinese contexts. Part 3 looks at the various ways the KJV has impacted the English language and literature, the practice of religion (including within the African American and Eastern Orthodox churches), and the broader culture. The contributors are Robert Alter, C. Clifton Black, David G. Burke, Richard A. Burridge, David J. A. Clines, Simon Crisp, David J. Davis, James D. G. Dunn, Lori Anne Ferrell, Leonard J. Greenspoon, Robin Griffith-Jones, Malcolm Guite, Andrew E. Hill, John F. Kutsko, Seth Lerer, Barbara K. Lewalski, Jacobus A. Naudé, David Norton, Jon Pahl, Kuo-Wei Peng, Deborah W. Rooke, Rodney Sadler Jr., Katharine Doob Sakenfeld, Harold Scanlin, Naomi Seidman, Christopher Southgate, R. S. Sugirtharajah, Joan Taylor, Graham Tomlin, Philip H. Towner, David Trobisch, and N. T.

                     <p>The American writer and critic Dwight Macdonald once wrote:</p>
                     <p>The King James Bible came at the end of the Elizabethan age, between Shakespeare and Milton, when Englishmen were using words more passionately, richly, vigorously, wittily, and sublimely than ever before or since. Although none of the divines or scholars who made it were literary men, their language was touched with genius—the genius of a period when style was the common property of educated men rather than an individual achievement.¹</p>
                     <p>As this borrowed Latin term,<italic>genius</italic>, has evolved in English usage, it has come to mean “an exceptional natural capacity</p>

                     <p>The KJV began to be written when the Israelites moved beyond telling to writing down their beliefs and the stories of their heritage.

                     <p>“The Bible only,” the English churchman William Chillingworth wrote in 1638, “is the religion of Protestants.” Whether it was also the religion of England’s Protestant church is the question that prompts this essay. It is a question rarely asked. A number of recent books, shrewdly timed to take advantage of the 400th anniversary of the so-called King James Bible, have focused our attention onto that enterprise of 1611 and the processes, political and scholarly, that allowed other early modern Bibles to be rendered into English. We are now well educated in the Bible’s literary influence, reception, and modes of translation.</p>

                     <p>The period from 1500 to 1650 saw the largest documented increase in the English vocabulary since the Norman Conquest.¹ It has been estimated that about 70 percent of our current, working lexicon comes from words borrowed from outside the language, and the overwhelming bulk of these words entered learned and common parlance in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Such words, too, were not simply lifted wholesale from other tongues. They were coined out of the raw material of classical example: inkhorn terms, aureate diction, denotations for scientific and technical material—all of these came to increase the vocabulary of the</p>

                     <p>English printing in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries is of immense importance to the King James Bible and is perhaps one of the most overlooked or oversimplified aspects of the Bible’s origin. Of course, it is not difficult to understand why this is the case. When compared to the Bible itself or its impact on Western society, the nature of English printing does not present nearly as riveting a subject.¹ When we gaze upon the monumental title page that introduced readers to what would become the most widely read English book, the printing industry fades like a dwindling shadow.</p>

                     <p>The question was properly and widely asked, during the 2011 celebration of the KJV’s quatercentenary, whether the KJV still satisfies the translators’ own aspirations. Two reservations mounted a more radical challenge: perhaps the KJV had not risen to its own ideals, even at the time. There would then be good reason to qualify the enthusiasm expressed for the KJV by its devotees.</p>
                     <p>First, the KJV was oddly archaic even in 1611. So much of its ubiquitous usage was out of date: “ye,” “doth,” hath,” and “saith.”¹ “Thou” and “thee” were by 1600 used by seniors to juniors (who used “you”</p>

Eventually the organizers of this symposium persuaded me to dig around. Since scholarly reporting and discussion of the origins and afterlife of the KJV has been overwhelmingly focused on the role of men in that story, I tried to approach my assignment from a wide range of angles. As I began to identify topics relating to women that might bear fruit, it quickly became evident that most of these areas should</p>

It may be prefaced, at the very beginning, with something similar to the<italic>Star Wars</italic>film series: “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” Or slightly more poetically one thinks of Bob Dylan’s song “Long Ago, Far Away” (1962):</p>

                     <p>Perhaps the two most influential documents that emerged from the Reformation period were Martin Luther’s translation of the Bible into German, which finally appeared in full in 1534, and the King James Version, whose 400th anniversary the English-speaking world celebrated in 2011. Both had an extensive and profound effect on the languages into which they were translated. Luther combined the various forms of contemporary German into one common vernacular usage, which became the basis for a standardized spoken and written language for centuries to come. The King James Version shaped the English language both in England itself and also in</p>

                     <p>Translations of sacred texts have often been accompanied by metatexts, which function to guide the reader in interpreting the text. The King James Version as it was originally published in 1611 included various kinds of metatexts. This paper examines three metatexts—two metatexts consisting of the two prefaces found in the preliminaries, and the set of marginal notes accompanying the translation. One preface was a three-page dedication to the king. A second, eleven-page preface to the translation articulated the aims and goals of the translators with great clarity. It also carefully specified the nature of the marginal notes as metatexts</p>

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the original principles and priorities of the translators of the King James Version as explicitly expressed in the prefaces to their translation. Having determined these principles and priorities from the original prefaces to the KJV, I then want to</p>

                     <p>Several years ago I was invited to teach an evening class at a liberal arts college in the Midwest. The topic of the session was apocalyptic literature. We read from the book of Daniel using the New International Version. At one point a student asked, “Why are we not reading the Bible in its original language?” I was impressed by this question, especially since some chapters of Daniel are written in Hebrew, while other chapters are written in Aramaic. It took a while before I realized that the student referred to the King James Version.</p>

                     <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, in both cases, though the KJV’s literal translation is unexceptionable, the original meaning has been misunderstood. “The root of the matter” is generally used today to mean the essential or inner part of something, the core,² but roots are more properly the origin of things than their essence. The friends whom Job imagines saying “the root of the matter is</p>

                     <p>Part of the reason for taking on this subject, I guess, was the memory of teenage irritation, more than fifty years ago, when I found myself increasingly frustrated at the many occurrences of “thou,” “thee,” and “ye”; the suffixes “-eth” and “-est”; and “hath,” “spake,” “wist,” “wax,” and “brethren.” It was all so old-fashioned, out of date, not language I would use in any other context than reading the Bible. So I suppose I wanted an opportunity to say how I came to find the KJV less and less satisfactory and satisfying as a translation. Not simply for me in</p>

                     <p>In a recent study of the relationship between the King James Version and English-language biblical translations by/for Jews, I concluded: “In no other language or culture does a single non-Jewish version exert such influence over Jewish translations.”¹ In order to establish a firm foundation for this declaration, two propositions must be demonstrated. The first, which is implicit in my statement, is that the KJV exerted a significant influence on subsequent Jewish English-language texts. The second, which I might term explicit, is that there are no parallels for such extensive influence by any other non-Jewish version in another language or culture.</p>

                     <p>The history of Protestant Chinese Bible translation is a long and complex one, 1 and therefore the role of the KJV in Protestant Chinese Bible translation needs to be discussed stage by stage. The first stage begins with the translation work of the first Protestant missionaries; the second stage begins with the first (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt at a Chinese Union Version; the third stage is an era of a plethora of Chinese Bible translations; and the last stage I wish to discuss starts with the translation process that led to the completion of a Union Version.</p>

                     <p>The phrase “lost in translation” is such a cliché that it even became the title of a movie. There is a famous story about a missionary starting a sermon by quoting Jesus’ words, “I am the good shepherd,” only to have the local interpreter tell the congregation, “He says he is a good man, and keeps goats.”</p>
                     <p>But things get lost just as effectively when, instead of translating, we stick with a foreign or ancient language that readers or hearers do not understand. This is so whether we are talking about the Bible or Shakespeare, about Schubert’s songs or Wagner’s</p>

Pushkin (1799–1837) consolidated Russia’s vernacular a century after East Slavic’s push and pull between Church Slavonic and Peter the Great (1672–1725).

                     <p>Why was there such a flowering of religious lyric poetry in England in the seventeenth century, and did the publication of the King James (or Authorized) Version in 1611 have anything to do with it? I think it did, for reasons and in ways I want to explore here. Some aspects of the Reformation and its aftermath in England seem hardly conducive to the development of religious arts—insistence on the single, literal sense of Scripture, iconoclasm, suspicion in some quarters about church music, anxieties about adding to or ornamenting the Word of God in sermons or poems, and the</p>

                     <p>The 400th anniversary of the publication of the King James Version of the Bible has given rise to many fine appreciations of the text and its influence.¹ There is no reason to gainsay these appreciations. The text does, often, dignify English with a singular sonorous sublimity. Yet the question I would like to consider today is less aesthetic than political. That is, what is the connection between the KJV and the emergence on the global stage of what I call, in my most recent book, an American empire of sacrifice?² Put more prosaically: Are there historical links between the KJV</p>

                     <p>A possible framework for this study is provided by the following question: What kind of influence of the King James Bible could we expect in the Orthodox world? Given that the majority of Orthodox Christians are familiar with the Scriptures in Greek or Slavonic, we might imagine that any influence would be either slight or nonexistent.</p>
                     <p>One possible starting point for our investigations could be the boom in Bible translation in the early nineteenth century, which was driven by the major English-speaking Bible societies in the colonial context of missionary expansion and included translation projects in many countries with majority</p>

                     <p>The King James Version of the Bible has been a prominent factor influencing the course of Western history for the past four hundred years. You need look no further than the African American community to find evidence for this claim. As a people, African Americans were not easy converts to Christianity. In fact, it took more than a century, two Great Awakenings, and the typically more egalitarian evangelistic tactics of the Baptists and Methodists for Christianity to begin to make significant inroads into African American communities. But more than these sociological factors, it took the stories from the pages of</p>

                     <p>In a field as well trodden as that of Bible translation, a would-be translator has two curiously dissimilar tasks. On the one hand, Bible translators at least since Jerome have insisted on the importance of “going back to the original text,” of coming closer to this original than previous efforts had succeeded in doing. On the other hand, new translations, particularly in the modern period, also aspire to differentiate themselves from their precursors who have worked in the same language, to gain the sort of status that accrues to new translations and is justly withheld from mere revisions.¹ Proximity and</p>

                     <p>On the Richter scale of English national affection, the King James Version is way at the top, like the late Queen Mother. The lovers of the King James Version often lapse into quasi-spiritual terminology when extolling its virtues and achievements. Listen to the words of William Canton, the passionate historian of the British and Foreign Bible Society: “The blind had a new world opened to them. Hospitals were supplied with small volumes suitable for the sick-wards, and many a little book was afterwards found under the pillow of the dead. In prisons, penitentiaries, workhouses, the Bible wrought wonders.”⁴ Those of</p>
