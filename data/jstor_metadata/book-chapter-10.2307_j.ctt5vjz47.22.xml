         <p>Readers of the Hebrew Bible are interested readers, bringing their own perspectives to the text. The essays in this volume, written by friends and colleagues who have drawn inspiration from and shown interest in the scholarship of David Clines, engage with his work through examining interpretations of the Hebrew Bible in areas of common exploration: literary/exegetical readings, ideological-critical readings, language and lexicography, and reception history. The contributors are James K. Aitken, Jacques Berlinerblau, Daniel Bodi, Roland Boer, Athalya Brenner, Mark G. Brett, Marc Zvi Brettler, Craig C. Broyles, Philip P. Chia, Jeremy M. S. Clines, Adrian H. W. Curtis, Katharine J. Dell, Susan E. Gillingham, Susanne Gillmayr-Bucher, Edward L. Greenstein, Mayer I. Gruber, Norman C. Habel, Alan J. Hauser, Jan Joosten, Paul J. Kissling, Barbara M. Leung Lai, Diana Lipton, Christl M. Maier, Heather A. McKay, Frank H. Polak, Jeremy Punt, Hugh S. Pyper, Deborah W. Rooke, Eep Talstra, Laurence A.

                     <p>According to William Moran,¹ the story in the Gilgameš Epic is structured around three seven-day periods, each being associated with a profound transformation of Gilgameš or his companion Enkidu.</p>
                     <p>1. In the first seven-day period (7 days + 7 nights in the Old Babylonian version, or 6 days + 7 nights in the Standard Babylonian version), Enkidu, the wild man who lives on the steppe with the animals, becomes humanized by epic lovemaking with Šamhat, sent to seduce him. His encounter with her serves to underline a sharp nature-culture contrast. She is the agent of acculturation: besides human lovemaking she</p>

He supported me early in my career, accepting my dissertation as a JSOT Supplement volume; he welcomed me to Sheffield when I was on sabbatical in England and wanted to discuss my second book, and has always been supportive of my work. His range, creativity, skill, boldness, and love of fun have served as a model for me, as has his ability to combine solid old-style philology with modern approaches to biblical studies.</p>

                     <p>The book of Psalms makes clear categorization and dogma impossible.¹ It is arguably the book of the Bible with the widest scope. Its tradition and literary history spans from the premonarchic period to the Second Temple period, and from social circles as varied as north and south, and from royal court and priestly temple to rural clan settings. We go from premonarchic victory songs to postexilic literary acrostics.</p>
                     <p>In this paper I attempt to trace the developing sources of tradition and memory reflected in the Psalms throughout the preexilic, exilic, and postexilic periods. I focus on psalms that can be</p>

The necessity for an approximation in the second sentence of this discussion highlights that there is not even complete agreement about their number, let alone their purpose and implication. There is widespread agreement on the</p>

                     <p>Wisdom’s most established aspirant is also her most (in)famous disappointment. Equipped with a burning ambition to establish himself as a worthy successor on the throne of David and his ability for critical reflection, blessed with God’s gift of a wise heart and the world’s admiration, Solomon nonetheless deceives all hopes when he turns his back on Wisdom by following her rival “Lady Folly.”</p>
                     <p>The image of Solomon as a wise king has been widely acknowledged. His role as wisdom’s aspirant, however, is usually neglected. The many voiced image of the great king presented in this story overwhelms the low key</p>

                     <p>In the second of his three monumental volumes on the book of Job in the Word Bible Commentary series, David Clines notes that, in the modern period, Elias Busitas in 1772 was the first scholar to suggest that the Elihu speeches found in Job, chapters 32–37, constituted later editions to the book of Job.¹</p>
                     <p>As Clines points out, among the reasons commonly advanced in favor of the idea that the Elihu speeches are not integral to the original design of the book of Job, we may mention three arguments:²</p>

                     <p>Although most traditional scholarship, situated as it has been in militaristic societies, describes the battles depicted in Joshua as a “conquest,” in fact the two major phases of that “conquest” are self-defense, first against an attack by a coalition of kings from the south of Canaan against the Gibeonites, who had recently joined Israel, and then defense against an attack on all of Israel by a coalition of kings from the north. The absorption of outsiders preceding an anticipated battle, the hyperbolic language of total destruction, the rules regarding the spoils of war, the extraordinary (divine) interventions, and the self-defensive</p>

Most significantly, he broke down the East-West dichotomy that lay at the heart of his earlier manifesto.

Is “retelling” a dream merely a form of innocent amusement or entertainment? Is retelling a nightmare a way of finding calm? Is the telling of a wish-fulfillment dream no more than a means of sharing with a friend or relative one’s hopes for a wished-for outcome? Or, perhaps less pleasantly, is telling a “dream” a means of giving some flavor of authenticity to a lie one wishes to tell to that other person?</p>

In the studies of biblical theology by Walter Brueggemann and Jack Miles,² the God of pathos belongs to the writer’s religious dictionary. Brueggemann strongly emphasizes the idiom that the Bible is “speech about God.” In his view this means that “Yahweh lives in, with, and under this speech”; and we, its readers, should feel urged to</p>

                     <p>The Marxist classicist, Geoffrey Ernest Maurice de Ste. Croix, belongs to the venerable if less-populated tradition of Marxist economic minimalism in regard to the ancient world, a tradition that includes Karl Polanyi and Moses Finley.¹ Ste. Croix’s major contribution is to have mounted a sustained and largely persuasive argument for the importance of class in the economies of ancient Greece and Rome, an argument that has profound relevance for biblical analysis.² In what follows, I provide a brief account of Ste. Croix’s central argument before exploring three questions concerning his account: one concerns trade, which is profoundly useful, and the</p>

                     <p>Professor David Clines has authored a number of provocative works in which he has argued, in various ways, for the rights of readers over against authors. In this essay I will engage with only two versions of the argument and make some observations on the relationships between them. In one version, which might be termed<italic>Ideologiekritik</italic>, he suggests that it is incumbent on critical readers to block the flow of ideology from biblical texts to scholarly commentary.¹ If this first version of the argument can be understood as a restriction on hermeneutical trade, then ironically, the second version sounds decidedly</p>

                     <p>Two notions, rooted in the rubrics of biblical interpretation in general and reading strategy in particular, form the conceptual framework and specific directives for this endeavor. First, the biblical text is an ideological production. This not only means that all texts have ideology, but that interpreters also read the text from their respective ideological formations.² The ideologies of the ancient community of Israel ingrained in the Hebrew Bible are “historically and culturally far removed from the ideologies of our owndays.”³ Engaging in ideological critical reading is, in essence, the merging of the two horizons—the horizon of the ancient text</p>

Scholars investigate and interpret biblical texts while exploring the value as well as the limitations of theories and methodologies in their work.¹ Older, existing theories are adjusted and new models are probed and developed.² Various biblical scholars see in postcolonial biblical interpretation a further development along the lines of ideological criticism—even if not perpetuating it. But what is postcolonial biblical interpretation? And how does it manifest in South(ern) Africa?

Invention in the material world or technological innovation are common causes in our day for vocabulary innovation: computer, mainframe, mobile (phone), tweet, blog. Such innovations lead to the creation of new words, or as in some of these cases (e.g., mobile), an extended denotation of an already existing word. An invention such as the bicycle not only gave us the new word itself, but led to the semantic extension of the verb “to ride.”¹ No longer did we ride only animals, but now we could also ride bicycles or other vehicles.

                     <p>The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²</p>

This issue may look like a mere technicality, of no interest for exegesis, history of religion, and literary criticism, but actually it is of highest importance, for it relates to the status of the speaking characters. On the face of it, the matter seems rather trivial: when the participants in the dialogue are unknown to the reader, they are to be mentioned by name and/or title, for the sake of clarity; but when it is clear whose move it is, no explicit indication is necessary.

                     <p>All scholars agree that there is linguistic variety in the Hebrew Bible. The dominant explanation of the distribution of linguistic forms in the Masoretic Text (MT) of the Hebrew Bible in modern scholarship has been in terms of a simple equation between the language of the MT and the language of the “original author” of the text in question. Current scholarship on the textual transmission of the Hebrew Bible, however, makes this explanation only one out of several—and not one of the more likely ones.</p>

                     <p>David Clines has been an original interpreter of things biblical for decades. His brands of interpretation have always been interesting, original, and erudite, combining the old and the new “on the way to the [post] modern.” His love of the Hebrew bible,¹ unromantic and nonromanticizing, critical yet steadfast, shines through his oeuvre: a veritable Torah scholar. He read and still reads in context and out of context, from various perspectives and directions: so to speak from left-to-right, his own idiom,² and also from right-to-left.³ In his work as a scholar, publisher, teacher, and administrator, he made a profoundly serious difference</p>

                     <p>In this paper I am interested in the way Job is treated in the nineteenth-century oratorio tradition in Britain. Sacred oratorio¹ took off in the nineteenth-century and had two primary forms—one of a more meditative nature (e.g., Handel’s<italic>Messiah</italic>) and the other of a more dramatic character (e.g., Mendelssohn’s<italic>Elijah</italic>).² Old Testament narratives were particularly suited to the dramatic variety, although the book of Job, unusually, provided both—action from the dramatic events recounted in the prologue and epilogue, and meditation from the dialogue, notably Job’s own speeches and God’s reply. Three oratorios based on Job represent well the</p>

David’s accomplishments in a variety of venues of biblical scholarship have truly been remarkable, as has been his assistance to other scholars in getting their works disseminated, both through the press he founded, and through the numerous journals he launched. David is a remarkable scholar and friend.</p>

                     <p>Among his other signal contributions to the development of biblical studies, David Clines has been a pioneering voice in the study of masculinity in biblical texts. It is a mark of his importance in this field that he contributes some “final reflections” to Ovidiu Creangă’s edited volume on<italic>Men and Masculinity in the Hebrew Bible and Beyond</italic>, in addition to contributing a chapter himself.¹ In these reflections, while acknowledging that the volume marks a coming of age for such studies, he makes a threefold plea for further work. First, he calls for a broadening of the theoretical base of masculinity</p>

                     <p>G. F. Handel’s oratorios were a development of the later years of his career, being written during the period 1732–1752. Most of the oratorios were “sacred dramas,” that is, operatic versions of Old Testament narratives, and they often had political as well as theological resonances. The oratorios were a chance development, having their origin in a piece written initially by Handel in 1718 or thereabouts for private performance at Cannons, the country seat of James Brydges (later duke of Chandos). The piece in question was<italic>Esther</italic>, a short, three-act musical drama, which tells a much-truncated version of the story</p>
