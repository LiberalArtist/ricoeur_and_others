         <p>The hypothesis of Paolo Bartoloni's book is based on the belief that a substantial and innovative discussion of the philosophical notions of immanence and potentiality is not only overdue but also necessary to address the social, political, cultural, and ethical aporia confronting us today.</p>

He is a bricklayer, who knows of only one language: the one spoken in his village. When he arrives in France, he believes that the local language is merely another dialect, like all the others he has encountered during his journey. As he always has done, the uncle gets by; he marries a French woman and</p>

                     <p>Translation is based, as Walter Benjamin intimates in his essay on translation, "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers" ("The Task of the Translator"; 1923), on an exhilarating paradox and a fundamental metaphysical conundrum. Benjamin's thesis is that translation is possible, indeed necessary, because all languages are connected to one original language (on language and translation in Benjamin see also Andrew Benjamin, "The Absolute"; Jacobs; and Fynsk). Benjamin calls this original language "pure language" ("die reine Sprache"). But perhaps "related" is a better word than "connected" since in Benjamin's thought there is a strong sense of origin and genealogy—of kinship ("Verwandtschaft"). It</p>

                     <p>Time slips away, time stops; it goes fast, proceeds erratically, it even stays still. Time keeps changing and yet never changes. We often speak of old time and new time, of present time, past time and future time. And yet, whenever we do this we do not talk about time: we talk about ourselves in time. What ages in time is not time itself but subjectivity. Calendars do not measure the passing of time, but the passing of lives in time. History is the site of this peculiar metonym through which what is measured and saved is, in reality, not</p>

                     <p>Writing simultaneously celebrates and questions the metaphysical foundations of Western thought. It asserts the tangibility of the subject that performs the act of writing but it also exposes the limitations of this very subjectivity. When we talk about writing we speak of a corporality mediated through ideas and inscribed in language. We do not see the author who writes, we only hear and listen to the language resonating on the page. The concrete meeting we experience as readers is with the author's language. It is indeed instructive that recent critical trends in literary study—in particular in the study of</p>

                     <p>Giorgio Caproni said that the idea to write the poem "Res amissa" occurred to him in a hotel room in Germany. Caproni was looking for a letter that he knew he had with him, but he could not find it.
