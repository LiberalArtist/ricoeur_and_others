The common thread of the essays in this volume is a sensitivity to the pressing need to place Darwin in the context of Victorian science. The organization of the work reflects the goal of building bridges between the study of an individual and his place in scientific culture. Part One,<italic>The Evolution of a Theorist</italic>, explores Darwin’s growth as a scientific thinker from his student days in Edinburgh to the writing of the<italic>Origin of Species</italic>.

                     <p>As a cognitive psychologist, my forays into the history of science have as their ultimate aim to contribute something to the psychology of thinking and the psychology of creativity. I hoped to learn from historical studies, and enrich my own rather crabbed, often Philistine field. In the course of this effort, my students and I found ourselves developing what we now call, quite provisionally, an “evolving systems approach to creative work” (Gruber 1980a, b).</p>
                     <p>In this view, creative work is seen as a purposeful growth process. Much work on the psychology of creativity reveals a certain tropism toward monolithicity. In</p>

                     <p>The<italic>Origin of Species</italic>was the culmination of Darwin’s theorizing of the previous twenty years. Its unique role in delineating the subsequent debates over all aspects of evolution account for the enduring interest in the construction of the<italic>Origin</italic>and the intellectual and other factors that helped shape its final form. We know from Darwin’s correspondence that he saw himself as constantly engaged in “species-work” during the period from 1840 to 1854. It was “far-distant work” but he did indicate to several of his correspondents that he intended to write a book on the species question, though he would “not</p>

                     <p>A source of difficulty in demonstrating a fundamental coherence in Darwin’s intellectual development has been created by a tendency to read his scientific thought as developing through a linear sequence of historical stages, each tending to replace the previous one. In terms of this familiar sequence, the Edinburgh years stand as an apparently self-contained period, leaving no mark of interest after 1827. Cambridge divinity studies and amateurish “beetle collecting” still seem to define for us the pre–<italic>Beagle</italic>Darwin, a stage which terminated when this somewhat unfocussed Cambridge gentleman was chosen to accompany the<italic>Beagle</italic>as its naturalist.

On board as ship’s naturalist sailed a young man, Charles Robert Darwin, who had yet to pass his twenty-third birthday. Earlier that year Darwin had taken a degree at Cambridge University, without honors, in preparation for becoming a clergyman.

                     <p>The earliest record we have of Darwin theorizing about the transmutation of species was written in March 1837 in a notebook labeled<italic>RN</italic>(127–131). These few hundred words at first seem impenetrable. By virtue of their conciseness and obscurity, they seem almost like the great thought caught at the moment of its birth. No bit of Darwiniana has inspired so much careful study; it is the Darwinist’s shroud of Turin.</p>

                     <p>Two decades of studies of the early notebooks have illumined the origins of Darwin’s theory of natural selection far beyond what was possible at the 1959 centennial when biographers still relied on Darwin’s later reminiscences.</p>
                     <p>The theory was arrived at during the months from Summer 1838 to Spring 1839 as Darwin was filling his<italic>Notebooks</italic>D and E.¹ We offer here a brief narrative of this theoretical discovery, drawing on more detailed analyses given, with fuller reference to the secondary literature, in Kohn (1980) and in Hodge (1982; forthcoming).

                     <p>Darwin as a lifelong generation theorist is a theme that can contribute very directly to any centennial reinterpretation of the Darwinian heritage.</p>
                     <p>Generation, here, concerns not only the production of an offspring by two parents; or any asexual productions from one parent, in budding say; or any from none at all, as in spontaneous generation. For Darwin extends the term to include the generation or propagation of new species from old; and even beyond that the propagation of the whole tree of life. The full range of Darwin’s biological thought is thus confronted.</p>
                     <p>It is confronted, moreover, in a way</p>

                     <p>However strongly we may see scientific ideas as socially and culturally contingent in their origin and expression, we must acknowledge that they are also the products of individuals. Hence even if we all consider scientific activity to be the reworking of prior scientific activity, the dynamics by which individual scientists develop their theories is a subject integral to the history of science. If we accept the proposition that knowledge grows by public and critical dialogue, we should not ignore the fact that important phases of the dialogue may occur within an individual. Such is the case for Charles Darwin, who</p>

                     <p>There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to</p>

                     <p>It is a fact familiar to all historians of science that Darwin was extremely slow to put his most important ideas into print. Having become a convinced transmutationist in 1837, he made such rapid progress over the next few years that he soon foresaw the prospect of writing a work that would revolutionize natural history. Yet it was not until 1844 that he produced an essay that was suitable for publication by his family in the event of his death; and fourteen years later, the unexpected arrival of Wallace’s short paper “On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from</p>

                     <p>The question I propose to answer in this paper is this: was the work Charles Darwin did as a young geologist compatible with the development of the field of geology in England in the 1830s, and, if so, how? I shall begin by outlining what I see as the major features of the development of geology as a field in England during the period. First, however, I should like to quote a statement on the subject by Martin Rudwick:</p>

                     <p>This note is a brief comment on Herbert’s interpretation of Darwin’s first chosen field of serious scientific research, the field in which he first earned respect as a highly competent “gentleman of science”. Herbert takes as her text a published comment of mine about what I termed the “dominant cognitive goal” of geologists at the period when Darwin joined their company (1979, pp. 10–11). I want to explain why this did not in fact imply a “narrow definition” of geology, and why there is therefore no paradox in identifying Darwin (and of course his older mentor Lyell) as central</p>

                     <p>In 1898, sixteen years after the death of Charles Darwin and two years after that of his wife Emma, the fate of their famous residence at Down was highly uncertain. The aging botanist Joseph Hooker, writing to Darwin’s son George, suggested that the historic house might well be saved for future generations by turning it to practical use as an experimental station for the study of animal breeding (Atkins 1974, p. 101). Although never taken up, the idea was an appropriate one. Almost from the very beginning of his career as a transmutationist, Darwin looked to the work of animal</p>

                     <p>Darwin’s writing profoundly unsettled the received relationships between fiction, metaphor, and the material world. That power of his was nurtured by his omnivorous reading. None of Darwin’s reading seems to have been in vain. It was all useable, and used, though relatively little of it was undertaken in a utilitarian spirit. We might apply the remarks of one of his favorite authors, Sir Thomas Browne, who wrote in the<italic>Religio Medici</italic>(1642): “<italic>Natura nihil agit frustra</italic>, is the only indisputable axiom in Philosophy; there are no<italic>Grotesques</italic>in nature; nor any thing framed to fill up empty cantons, and unnecessary</p>

                     <p>It is well known that Darwin’s theory of evolution was founded in the first instance on two kinds of observations: the occurrence of variations in animals and plants and the inheritability of such variations. In the opening chapter of the<italic>Origin</italic>, Darwin refers specifically to the existence of variation among “individuals of the same variety or sub-variety” and to the “endless” “number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance” (pp. 7,12). Since far more individuals are regularly produced than can possibly survive, there is a consequent “struggle for life” or</p>

Only positivists believe that scientific facts and theories are separate from human meanings and values, and even they, inconsistently, set out to extrapolate human and social conclusions from putatively decontextualized facts. Only religious fundamentalists believe that a belief in God cannot be reconciled with science, and that true religion is based on the literal truth of Scripture. This is a sort of religious positivism, as is the notion of creation science, which the ultra-right is currently deploying in opposition to a vulnerable, neo-Darwinian scientific orthodoxy, as part of</p>

                     <p>Certain images spring immediately to mind whenever the scientific reaction to Darwinism is mentioned. For many, Thomas Henry Huxley’s response to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce at the Oxford BAAS meeting in 1860 symbolizes the scientists’ refusal to bow to outside pressure. Huxley’s debate with Richard Owen over man’s relationship to the apes illustrates the clash between the radical and conservative responses within science, as do the efforts of Asa Gray and William Barton Rogers to defend Darwinism against the attacks of Louis Agassiz in the United States. Many laymen no doubt assume that once the initial opposition was overcome, Darwinism soon</p>

Glick (1974) has witnessed important changes in research on evolutionary ideas in Europe. More case studies on Germany have appeared; Professor Yvette Conry has published her large volume on French non-reactions to Darwin; and a new generation of Italian historians of science has undertaken to explore the immense and immensely under-researched territory of Italian reactions to Darwin. Yet at present, as in 1972, the task of offering a balanced comparative assessment of Darwinian debates within the major European countries proves daunting. For the most part,</p>

                     <p>As is well known, Darwin produced a large number of theories, many of which dealt explicitly with evolution or special aspects of it, and many others of which were closely related to problems in evolution, although the evolutionary aspect was only implicit. Furthermore, throughout his life Darwin varied the emphasis he placed on different processes and mechanisms, and, for some of them, he radically altered his position. In his published works, Darwin hardly ever indicated precisely how any single topic he discussed could or should be connected with other topics, in an overall interpretative framework of evolutionary phenomena.

In reality Darwin’s “theory” of evolution was a whole bundle of theories, and it is impossible to discuss Darwin’s evolutionary thought constructively if one does not distinguish the various components of which it consists. But quite aside from the fact that it helps understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory, to carry the analysis to the level of the subtheories Darwin adopted, it is important to call attention to the composite nature of the Darwinian theory for three very</p>

                     <p>In a recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, several eminent scientists addressed the question: What happened to Darwinism between the two Darwinian Centennials, 1959–1982?¹ An unanticipated problem soon arose — none of the participants could agree on what Darwinism actually was. Each speaker was sure that Darwinism has an essence, a set of tenets that all and only Darwinians hold, but no two could agree about which tenets are actually essential. Is selectionism essential? Must nearly all traits and all adaptations arise through natural selection, or does the neutralist alternative also count as part</p>

                     <p>If I borrow my title from Kellogg (1907), it is because it aptly defines, I think, the real meaning of our colloquium and perhaps the present state of affairs about evolutionary theory. After 1909 and 1959, this is the third Darwinian centenary year. On the situation in 1909 we have a valuable testimony, the book published by the Cambridge University Press “at the suggestion of the Cambridge Philosophical Society” with the title<italic>Darwin and Modern Science</italic>. In all the essays that composed the book, Darwin’s genius and outstanding role in biology, natural history, and allied sciences were unanimously praised, but</p>

                     <p>Do the primary mechanisms of evolution in nature lead to adaptation? This has remained a persistently controversial question from the appearance of Charles Darwin’s<italic>Origin</italic>in 1859 until the present. The main reason for this persistent controversy is that evolutionists have disagreed about whether or not the observed differences between closely related taxa (especially at the species level) are adaptive, and disagreed about the prevailing mechanisms of microevolution (evolution up to the level of geographical races or subspecies), speciation, and macroevolution (evolution above the species level). Although the question of adaptation in relation to mechanisms of evolution became more narrowly</p>

                     <p>Whig history is full of threats and promises. Interpreting the past in terms of the present has its dangers; since the present did not cause the past, one can be misled in the search for explanation. But when the question we put to the past concerns its meaning, matters change; seeing the significance of the past may well essentially involve seeing it in terms of the present.</p>
