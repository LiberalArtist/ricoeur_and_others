      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>In an age of authorless, contextless, deconstructed texts, Francis-NoÃ«l Thomas argues that it is time to re-examine a fundamental but neglected concept of literature: writing is an action whose agent is an individual. Addressing both general readers and scholars, Thomas offers two cases, Bernard Shaw's<italic>Saint Joan</italic>and Marcel Proust's<italic>A la recherche du temps perdu</italic>, read against the background of the authors' large, eccentric, and surprisingly similar claims about their texts as acts. He examines what happens when we take these claims seriously enough to find out why the authors made them in the first place and what bearing they have on the texts themselves.</p>

                     <p>In<italic>An Appetite for Poetry,</italic>Frank Kermode tells of seeing on the door of a laboratory at UCLA a posted quotation from the<italic>Carnets d’un biologiste</italic>of Jean Rostand:<italic>“Les théories passent. Le grenouille reste.”</italic>Kermode comments, “There is a risk that in the less severe discipline of criticism the result may turn out to be different; the theories will remain but the frog may disappear.” In redefining the study of literature, recent theorists in the traditions of structuralism and post-structuralism have offered sophisticated abstract concepts intended to replace our pre-theoretical commonplace experience of literature. Often self-consciously “scientific,” these theories</p>

To have such a concept is to have a concept of literature.

                     <p>This book began with an image of the writer writing, an icon for a concept of literature based on a commonplace concept of human action. It is a concept of literature that situates agency in an individual human being. Texts, in this perspective, are the actions of individual writers. They can be understood in the same way that we understand other human actions undertaken by individuals. Writing, looked upon in this way, is one of a range of things that people do. It is better documented than many other human activities, but it is not isolated from them. On the</p>

                     <p>Explanation is almost co-extensive with consciousness. “Explanations”—the title of this chapter—is a much less daunting topic. The following discussion is limited to a description of two distinct models of explanation, the “scientific” or “covering law” model and the historical or “processive” model and an analysis of how these two models are ‘parodied’ respectively by Shaw and Proust in their particular acts as writers, their philosophic acts of explanation.</p>

                     <p>In the course of discussing the concept of historical interpretation in the opening chapter, I quoted R. G. Collingwood on the proper way to understand “what a man means.” This phrase was conventional in 1939, the publication date of Collingwood’s book. This nuance of his discourse helps to date him by placing him within a set of conventions about gender. Such conventions have changed so much in the ensuing fifty years that if an Oxford professor of philosophy were to use this phrase today in a similar context, it would seem pointed.</p>
