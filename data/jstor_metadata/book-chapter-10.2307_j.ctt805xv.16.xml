                     <p>Musician, writer, composer, teacher, and colleague – Istvan¹ Anhalt has been a major figure on the Canadian music scene for five decades. Born into a Jewish family in Budapest in 1919, Anhalt studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music with Zoltán Kodály before being conscripted into a forced labour camp during the war. In the late 1940s he studied in Paris with Louis Fourestier, Nadia Boulanger, and Soulima Stravinsky, and emigrated to Canada in 1949, sponsored by a Lady Davis Fellowship for displaced European intellectuals and artists. Settling first in Montreal, he taught at McGill University for twenty-two years,</p>

                     <p>Anhalt is an uncommon family name, and among people of Jewish origin it is exceptionally rare. In the course of his own casual but fairly extensive genealogical research into his family origins, Istvan Anhalt uncovered only one other Jewish family of that name in Europe, located in Poland.¹ According to an unsubstantiated and likely unprovable story told to Anhalt by his father, the family ancestors came from Dessau, the town where the princes of Anhalt-Dessau had their residence.² As the name Anhalt was reserved for members of the ruling family in Dessau, it must have been adopted by Anhalt’s ancestors</p>

                     <p>Anhalt’s emigration to Canada was part of a significant postwar demographic movement. In 1946 the Canadian government approved emergency measures to allow the immigration of refugees and displaced persons in a belated attempt to make amends for having done so little to provide safe haven for the oppressed of Europe during the war. Between 1947 and 1952, over 165,000 people arrived in Canada under the terms of these emergency measures. Like Anhalt, the majority of them came by boat from Europe and were processed through Halifax’s Pier 21, a large two-storey immigration building with barred windows on the waterfront in</p>

                     <p>The pathway that led Istvan Anhalt from McGill to Queen’s appeared only after much reflection. As seen in chapter 2, Anhalt’s decision to leave his full-time professorship at McGill University for Queen’s in 1971 did not come easily. He had worked at McGill since his arrival in Canada in 1949 with good results, building up the theory and composition department, establishing the Electronic Music Studio, and forming his reputation as a teacher and a composer. Over the twenty-two year period in Montreal, Anhalt had also found a stimulating circle of colleagues and friends, both English and French speaking. As an</p>

                     <p>Anhalt’s purely instrumental solo and chamber music dates, with one important exception, from early in his career. Most of the music he composed in Europe falls into this category, as do the works he wrote during his first six years in Canada. The only chamber music work to date that reflects the style of Anhalt’s later operatic, vocal, and orchestral compositions is<italic>Doors … shadows (Glenn Gould in memory)</italic>. The works under consideration here, with place and date of completion in parentheses, are as follows:</p>

                     <p>Istvan Anhalt first heard electronic music during a broadcast in the late 1950s on cbc radio, hosted by Helmut Blume. Blume often travelled in Europe, and he had acquired, in Germany, broadcast tapes of two works by Karlheinz Stockhausen. One of the works Anhalt heard was<italic>Studie ii</italic>(1954), a work created from white noise¹ carefully filtered to produce striking contrasts in timbre. The second and more recent work was<italic>Gesang der Jünglinge</italic>(1955–56), a remarkable piece created through transformations of the voice of a boy soprano mixed with electronically produced sounds. This latter work remains one of the</p>

                     <p>Over the past half-century, Istvan Anhalt has produced a body of work as technically refined, as rich in meaning, and as fully engaged with musicality as any other from this period. There are reasons why it does not enjoy the wide recognition accorded other oeuvres, of which many have less potential to reward the discerning listener. The professional cost of reaching full production only after the age of fifty can be cited – if easily explained by way of thirty-five years of unstinting devotion to teaching – as can the fractured state of musical politics (like all politics) in Canada,</p>

                     <p>Anhalt is a poetic composer, one who values words for both sound and meaning. Moreover, he is intrigued by the ways in which words and music meet, and in his book<italic>Alternative Voices</italic>¹ he offers original and penetrating discussions of the changing treatment of text in conjunction with music. What distinguishes<italic>Alternative Voices</italic>is the way in which Anhalt examines texted musical compositions from the verbal side of things, rather than more conventionally from the musical side, and it is this approach that serves as a model for the following consideration of Anhalt’s compositions that use texts.²</p>

It’s hard to pinpoint precisely what drew us together. Surely our initial responses to each other’s music, but beyond that, those human places from which music itself arises. One of William Blake’s proverbs comes to mind: “the bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.” Genuine friendship is not possible without the kinship of shared attitudes, tastes, interests.

                     <p>Throughout his career in Canada, Istvan Anhalt has demonstrated a stimulating talent not only for composing but also for writing about music. For all of his own major compositions he has provided at least one and in some instances several essays explaining the work’s aesthetic and musical qualities. His major contribution as an engaged and profound thinker about music is his book<italic>Alternative Voices</italic>, in which he brings his wide learning to bear on the subject of contemporary vocal and choral composition. It seems fitting, then, to include Anhalt’s voice here, in a number of essays that deal with his</p>

                     <p>I am writing this in December 1997, about a year and a half after the premiere of<italic>Traces</italic>(<italic>Tikkun</italic>). I am now in the midst of composing a new work for voices and orchestra which I am calling “A Voice-Drama for the Imagination.” As on earlier occasions, the thought that these works might be related, in some way, to my earlier works for voices (<italic>Comments, Cento, Foci, Thisness</italic>, and others) keeps coming back to mind.

                     <p>Finally here … I’m late … came from a distance … My name … Lady Diotima – Diotima for short … At one time I was called “Diotima the sorceress,” but I never cared for that tag. Others remembered me as the noted courtesan, a friend of the wise … Oh love!
