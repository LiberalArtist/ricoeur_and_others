                     <p>Members of the political science community in Canada were saddened to hear of the sudden death of one of their most respected colleagues, Khayyam Zev Paltiel, on April 17, 1988. For those of us who had spent some time at Carleton University, either as students or as teachers, and who came to know Khayyam, the loss was particularly painful. Many of us in the Political Science department at Carleton had unthinkingly assumed that there would always be a Khayyam Paltiel wandering the corridors of the sixth floor in the Loeb Building, a copy of the<italic>Globe and Mail</italic>or the</p>

                     <p>My father, K.Z. Paltiel, was born into a well-to-do family in the Jewish neighbourhood of Montreal on March 16, 1922. This was the same neighbourhood evoked by the poet A.M. Klein and later satirized by Richler. His father, Aaron David, who immigrated from Romania just before the turn of the century, had started off as a dry-goods merchant in Northern Ontario in Porcupine and North Bay, but settled down in Montreal around the time of the First World War and built up a successful business as a real estate developer and property manager. His mother, Bella Ruth, was a much</p>

                     <p>I first met Khayyam Paltiel 50 years ago. We had both recently graduated from high school in Montreal, and in the unsettled period of 1939 and early 1940, we were both uncertain about what to do or where to go. This was a period when our fellow high school graduates were joining the RCAF as air-crew trainees, or the army and the RCN as officers, but at that time, as my Member of Parliament informed me in a letter after a discussion with the Minister, these paths were closed to all of those with non-Caucasian background, including Jews. Hence, it</p>

                     <p>It is a very great honour for me to remember Khayyam Paltiel, a man who was to me, in turn, teacher, research director, colleague, and friend. It is a daunting task when one is called upon to provide a theme appropriate to a man as complex and as many-talented as Khayyam. I briefly pondered the idea of providing a serious summation of the value of Khayyam’s intellectual legacy as embodied in his published writings, of reflecting on the significance of his work on political finance, political patronage, interest groups, nationalism, minority rights and so on. Eventually I chose not to</p>

                     <p>Constitutional democracy with its veneration of the rule of law and the condition of equality seems, as it enters the last decade of the twentieth century, to be more sharply defined than ever before as the regime which best satisfies the human quest for freedom and dignity. As the ideological conflict of this tumultuous century abates, and parousiastic regimes¹ retreat, teeter and collapse, history offers the astonishing prospect of an underlying democratic movement taking the form of a constitutional dialectic. This dialectic in its present mature stage is a conversation, conducted by legislatures, courts and citizens, about the fundamental questions</p>

                     <p>In an article written shortly before the passage of the Constitution Act, 1982, Peter Russell declared that in Canada there was no informed discussion about the proper purview of courts in a democratic society. As a consequence, Russell said, future court decisions based on the Charter would provide Canadians with a crash course in the promises and perils of judicial policy-making (Russell, 1982:33). After seven years of this crash course, what lessons have we learned about judicial policymaking? The most conspicuous lesson is that, in spite of numerous predictions to the contrary, Canadian courts have shown themselves, in cases covering</p>

                     <p>The topic of this chapter would no doubt have pleased Khayyam Paltiel, because he was intensely interested in the improvement of our democratic institutions and procedures. As is well known, Ontario’s new right of access to governmental and personal documents is an example of a democratic reform that has been adopted in many western democracies. Perhaps I should first explain why I decided to focus on the system established in Ontario. One reason is that it is very recent. The schemes in Quebec, New Zealand, Australia and its state of Victoria, and the federal scheme in Canada, were all adopted</p>

                     <p>“Politics,” Michael Oakeshott has argued, “is the activity of attending to the general arrangements of a set of people whom chance or choice have brought together” (1967:112). In light of the extraordinary political changes taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this view of politics seems rather staid and unspirited. But Oakeshott’s point is worth repeating: as a learning process deeply rooted in the particular historical circumstances of a people, ordinary politics is a matter of intimations. It is the activity of translating and inscribing the allusive fluctuations of everyday collective existence into familiar and routine terms of reference. Politics,</p>

                     <p>The partisan and passionate debate surrounding the Meech Lake Accord of 1987 was due, in large measure, to the fact that it was dominated, in the words of Alan Cairns, by “special interest advocacy that is sustained by the driving ambitions of governments and by private interests with stakes in the constitution” (Cairns, 1989:32). The very structure of our Constitution ensures a conflict between competing vested interests. The amending formula, which is controlled exclusively by the first ministers, pits governments and their legislatures against one another.

                     <p>In spite of notable efforts by medieval theologians and modern constitutional lawyers to render their respective crafts esoteric, some things remain fundamentally simple. That is to say, their essentials can be understood by lay people possessing a little detachment and good will. Among these simple matters we may rank the basic relationship between Francophones and Anglophones in Canada, which appears reasonably clear to most informed observers outside the country, but which is obscured for many Canadians by the shadows and myths of the cave society in which they pass their lives. My main argument in this paper is that the</p>

                     <p>When historians begin talking about political culture real social scientists are inclined to wince. To take a political culture approach even to modern politics is full of problems; to attempt a historical account of the evolution of a particular polity’s culture is fraught with so many serious methodological questions that it seems wiser, and certainly safer, to avoid the challenge altogether. In his 1983 survey of the discipline of political science, Dennis Kavanagh, of the University of Nottingham, sets out the dilemma well. Kavanagh provides a minimalist definition of political culture, first devised by Talcott Parsons and Edward Shils in</p>

                     <p>The study of patronage and clientelism — which has burgeoned in the social sciences since the late 1960s — can be considered part of a broader reaction against evolutionary assumptions about the presumed generalized move of modern society towards Western liberal forms of political development and bureaucratic-universalism. From different vantage points, these assumptions were seriously questioned by the research of scholars who analyzed the actual operation of modern institutions. Thus, over and above their concrete contribution, works by Khayyam Paltiel on the financing of modern parties and studies on political machines by J.

                     <p>“The power of rewarding modest worth is perhaps the sweetest blessing that attends Rank &amp; authority, for our Great Master tells us that it is more blessed to give than to receive.” Thus wrote the Reverend John Strachan in 1818 (Spragge, 1946:186). For understandable reasons, however, prime ministers, premiers, and others in high political office have been inclined to view the business of bestowing discretionary rewards — that is, the dispensing of patronage — in a less altruistic light, and their power over it as less of a blessing than, as Brian Mulroney put it, “a pain in the neck” (Simpson, 1988:355).</p>

Mais elle a aussi couramment supposé une volonté d’egalité entre les citoyens qui venait conditionner la poursuite de l’idéal démocratique. De ce point de vue, on a souvent présumé que “l’égale dignité de la personne humaine” se trouvait bien reconnue dans l’extension du suffrage universel. Ce faisant, on négligeait de noter l’immense décalage parfois reperable entre la reconnaissance en principe et la promotion-protection en pratique du droit de vote de chaque citoyenne et citoyen.</p>

                     <p>Thinking about modes of interest representation has undergone several permutations in recent years, as major alterations in post-war electoral coalitions mark the emergence of new political actors, partisan strategies, and forms of state/society and global relations. The diversity of literatures analyzing neo-corporatism, new social movements, New Left and post-modern politics indicates that the theoretical perspectives on liberal democracy which dominated political science and sociology after 1945 required reconceptualization. Moreover, since the political events provoking new theory occurred in conjunction with a profound crisis and restructuring of economic relations, even political economy approaches began to reassess representation.</p>

                     <p>As a scholar of Canadian politics, Khayyam Z. Paltiel was concerned with the appropriate and equitable representation of interests in the policy process. In particular, he addressed the issue of whether interest groups have displaced political parties as the fundamental agents of representation and democratic legitimation in the Canadian political system and he examined the impact of special interest groups on the Canadian state (1989, 1982). Because interest groups of all kinds have proliferated since the 1960s, they now are often in vigorous competition with each other, as well as with political parties, in the policy-making process. However, interest groups</p>

                     <p>The existence of an increased level of environmental consciousness, of the kind experienced in the 1980s, will create new opportunities for change. However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like. Relations with our environment will not be set once and for all or encapsulated in one big “action plan,” but will arise out of much trial and error, changed individual behaviour, political dispute and compromise, and diverse policy initiatives developed over time and unique to specific circumstances.</p>

                     <p>Les années 1980 ont été marquées au Québec par l’explosion des activités entrepreneuriales d’une nouvelle classe des affaires jeune, innovatrice et dynamique. L’augmentation fulgurante des inscriptions aux écoles de commerce du Québec — les séminaires des années 1980 — la hausse des investissements et la vigoureuse reprise de la Bourse de Montréal après une incartade vers le gouffre de l’oubli témoignent de pépanouissement de ce que K.Z. Paltiel appelle la bourgeoisie balzacienne, ou la bourgeoisie des affaires (Paltiel, 1985-86). Ce phénomène annonce d’ailleurs une réorientation plus profonde encore du milieu socio-culturel du Québec. Comme le note Graham Fraser: “[À partir de 1983]</p>

In similar fashion, economic change has brought Quebec’s new francophone business class to a dominant place within politics, government and society, so that</p>

                     <p>The centrality of “clean, fair, honest elections” — what might reasonably be called ethical elections — in a democratic system is widely understood by citizens, politicians and academics alike. The very nature of democratic legitimacy rests, in large part, on the integrity of the electoral process, however this integrity might be defined. Given normal expectations typical of many sociopolitical concepts, this definition will vary in detail from one political system to another, or from one subsystem to another within the same political system.</p>

Paltiel observed some years ago that parties generally had been unable to rely exclusively on individuals for raising funds, without the assistance of corporate, union or government bureaucracies (Paltiel, 1981). On 26 August 1977, royal assent was given in the Province of Quebec to a Bill (No.2) regulating political party financing. This legislation was, and has remained, quite unique by Canadian standards, insofar as it prohibited contributions from corporations, labour unions and individuals living outside the province: only provincial electors could henceforth contribute to parties (Massicotte, 1984).

                     <p>Are Canada’s political parties in “decline” ? Do they matter less to voters and citizens now than they did during that mythical golden age of Macdonald, Laurier, Mackenzie King, and St. Laurent? Are they less successful now than they once were in mobilizing voters, structuring political choices, or generating policy ideas? These are the sorts of questions that Khayyam Paltiel addressed in one of his last published works (Paltiel, 1989), a wide-ranging survey of the impact of changing political technologies (polling, consulting, direct mail, and so on) on the health of party organizations in both Canada and the United States.</p>

                     <p>The study of political parties, like that of other subjects, is from time to time jolted by the appearance of seminal works so enriching and transforming the art that they elevate it to a new plateau. The books by Ostrogorski (1902), Michels (1915), Key (1942), Schattschneider (1942), Duverger (1954), McKenzie (1955), Eldersveld (1964), and Sartori (1976), among others, comprise such milestones on our road to the mastery of the party phenomenon. A potentially similar formative flashpoint burst on the scene in 1949, when R.K. Merton’s “Manifest and Latent Functions” (a revision of an earlier paper) appeared in the first edition</p>

                     <p>From a very early time in his academic career Paltiel was concerned with the inequalities that party and campaign financing introduced into the Canadian political system. Paltiel was critical of the ever-growing distance between the supposed democratic principles of the system and the vast differences in group power and influence that characterized the environment in which party and campaign financing operated.

                     <p>My Father was a man full of paradox. He used to say: “Consistency is the soul of mediocrity.” He was not consistent, and he was not mediocre. His love for us was unmistakable, but was hardly ever expressed aloud. His scholarly prose was crystal clear and unambiguous, and yet his letters were scrawled in a scratchy vertical script, almost illegible to the uninitiated, and which often had hardly one personal word except his signature — “Daddy.” His mind was methodical, decisive, and fastidious, and yet his desk was a litter of unsorted papers, books, articles, notes, bills . . .
