      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Moving away from Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, and building on his experiences as a politician, Vattimo asks if it is still possible to speak of moral imperatives, individual rights, and political freedom. Acknowledging the force of Nietzsche's "God is dead," Vattimo argues for a philosophy of pensiero debole or "weak thinking" that shows how moral values can exist without being guaranteed by an external authority. His secularising interpretation stresses anti-metaphysical elements and puts philosophy into a relationship with postmodern culture.</p>

                     <p>There is a mode of thinking in modern moral philosophy that is perhaps most evident in analytical philosophy in the Anglo-Saxon world, but also influential elsewhere. Analytic philosophy has lots of good qualities. But one of its drawbacks is a tendency to narrowness on certain questions. And one of the most marked sites of this narrowness is in moral philosophy.</p>
                     <p>The narrowness concerns more than just the range of doctrines considered, though it also consists in that. But more fundamentally, it has restricted the range of questions that it seems sensible to ask. In the end it has restricted our</p>

                     <p>One of Gianni Vattimo’s indisputable accomplishments over the past three decades has been to carry forward the “urbanizing of Heidegger” (to use the famous expression of Jürgen Habermas) initiated by the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer in his truly<italic>epochemachend</italic>work of 1960 –<italic>Truth and Method</italic>. To that end, Vattimo’s philosophical program – expressed by the very successful formula “weak thought,” but in my view more adequately summed up in the expression “ontology of decline” – has made crucial contributions to the international scene, thanks to the initial convergence and to the subsequent uninterrupted confrontation with the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty.

                     <p>Vattimo’s paper on weak thinking is strongly argued, at least in its general strategy.¹ He first describes the dialectical mode of philosophizing, then opposes it to the differential mode that “combats” dialectics while remaining “deeply complicitous” with it, and finally sublates both: weak ontology is “constructed not only by developing the discourse of difference, but also by recalling dialectics.” This is strong thinking indeed, perhaps unintendedly so. The Hegelian as well as the Heideggerian positions are to be<italic>aufgehoben,</italic>since ours is the time in which both modes of reappropriating the past have proved asthenic.

                     <p>Gianni Vattimo’s writings are among the most imaginative contributions to the tradition of philosophical thought that flows from Nietzsche and Heidegger. They are well suited to the needs of those who would like to gain an understanding of the intellectual outlook he calls “nihilism.”</p>
                     <p>That outlook might also be called “common sense Heideggerianism.” It is widespread among European intellectuals. Many people who, like Vattimo and Derrida, were students in the 1950s were deeply impressed by Heidegger essays such as “Letter on Humanism,” “The Question concerning Technology,” “The Origin of the Work of Art,” and “Nietzsche’s Word: God is Dead.”¹ Many</p>

                     <p>I met Gianni Vattimo in the early eighties at a colloquium at the Goethe-Institute in Turin.

                     <p>Gianni Vattimo wants philosophy to continue. This obvious statement appears at first sight to be vacuous, almost nonsensical, when employed to begin writing about a philosopher. After all, does not every philosopher by the act of philosophizing engage de facto in the continuation of philosophy? The apparent emptiness of this statement quickly disappears, though, when, as in the case of Vattimo’s philosophical project, there is an announcement of the end of philosophy such that there is indeed a question not actually of whether philosophy is to continue but of the way in which it is able to continue. The announcement</p>

                     <p>We have many reasons to be grateful to Gianni Vattimo for his continuing contribution to philosophy and public life. Undoubtedly, his most decisive philosophical impulses have come from the German philosophical tradition, and mostly from the Holy Trinity of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Gadamer, who was his teacher. Yet he was not German but a proud Italian and for some reason more able than others to carry this tradition further. The German philosophical tradition has to a large extent dominated philosophy since Leibniz and Kant, but its dominion ebbed considerably after Husserl, Heidegger, and Gadamer. One could attribute this decline to</p>

                     <p>Jürgen Habermas occasionally characterized Hans-Georg Gadamer’s work with gentle irony as the “urbanization of Heideggerian parochialism.” As a student, I myself took a lively interest in this kind of controversy. The so-called Frankfurt School retreated from neo-Marxism to a Kantianizing theory of speech acts. On the other hand, the Heideggerian efforts on behalf of ontology merged into the universe of hermeneutic interpretation. I heard a lot of tales from inside the Heidegger School and met and fully admired the master himself on his sporadic visits to seminars that he held for his disciples in Heidelberg. Habermas participated in my PHD</p>

George Steiner presented him not only as “the most eminent philosopher or critic of metaphysics since Immanuel Kant but also as one of that small number of decisive Western thinkers that would include Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, and Hegel”; Hannah Arendt described him as “the secret king of thought throughout twentiethcentury philosophic sensitivity”; and when he died on 26 May 1976 , a number of European philosophers affirmed that</p>

                     <p>In a decisive way, Gianni Vattimo has helped to make hermeneutics the hegemonic philosophy of our time, bending the Heideggerian legacy towards “the left,” where the theme of the forgetting of Being and the nostalgic commitment of philosophy to its “recollection” transforms itself into Being’s weakening/exhausting, into Being’s dissolutive destiny; that is, into modernity equated with the “long goodbye” to Being.</p>
                     <p>But it is hardly ever pointed out how this way of thematizing Being makes the philosophy of Vattimo an<italic>essentially</italic>moral philosophy, or more precisely, an ethico-<italic>political</italic>philosophy.

                     <p>Notwithstanding Lyotard’s characterization of postmodernity’s incredulity toward grand metanarratives, the most interesting and provocative philosophy in our time is that being painted with meta broad brushes. When distinguished philosophers fashion overarching narratives, they help us hold things together in a synoptic vision; by painting forests for us, they make those of us who read too many books able at least to see more than just the trees. Gianni Vattimo and Richard Rorty, metanarrators both, and two of the most original philosophers writing today, invite comparison of their overlapping but distinct narratives on religion and secularization, which I will undertake in</p>

                     <p>A few years ago, a dialogue of more or less theological character between Umberto Eco and Cardinal Martini was published; as an annex, it included interventions by other important Italian thinkers. The title of the book surprised me:<italic>Belief or Nonbelief?</italic>¹ Since the question in the title referred to the beliefs of those who do not believe in God or in religious dogmas, the answer was a fairly obvious one: they believe in the demonstrations of the natural phenomena established by science, in what is endorsed by historical or social studies, in the pertinence of moral values, and so on.</p>

                     <p>As the author of books explicitly about the Jewish and Christian scriptures – books, however, in which by design I reveal nothing about my personal stance with regard to religion, I am often asked whether or not I am, after all, a believer. My extemporaneous answers never satisfy me but only, perhaps, reveal why I have so studiously avoided the question. But since the publication of Gianni Vattimo’s<italic>Credo di credere,</italic>I have developed a better answer. Read Vattimo, I say, and you will acquaint yourself with my predicament better than I could acquaint you with it myself.</p>

                     <p>A disclaimer, to begin with: I was trained not as a philosopher but as a scholar of comparative literature, and Italian is not among the languages I read. Neither Gadamer, Gianni Vattimo’s teacher – nor Heidegger, Gadamer’s – is a thinker who means much to my own work or had any place in my education. I find aspects of the hermeneutic enterprise counterproductive. My relationship to Vattimo, therefore, is unobvious, yet definable precisely. Our relation is editorial.</p>

This seems to be one of the most meaningful demands put forth in the reflections of Gianni Vattimo, especially in the wake of his philosophical proposal that finds an<italic>ouverture</italic>under debate in the metaphor of weak thought, in the sense that it radicalizes a form of reflection that is (seemingly) closer to deconstruction. The issue appears even more intriguing if it is limited to the relation between philosophy and religion. There is a well-known irreconcilability</p>

Lyotard announced the advent of the<italic>postmodern condition.</italic>¹ However, the most disquieting thing was, without a doubt, the tempestuous news that, in a fashion similar to the announcement of the death of God by Nietzsche, was contained in his report on the societies of telematic capitalism: the news of the end of the Western metaphysical metanarratives, demythologized as tall tales written by – and, moreover, mimicking W.</p>
