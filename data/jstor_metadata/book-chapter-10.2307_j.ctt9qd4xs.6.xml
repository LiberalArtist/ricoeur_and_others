         <p>Grassroots memorials have become major areas of focus during times of trauma, danger, and social unrest. These improvised memorial assemblages continue to display new and more dynamic ways of representing collective and individual identities and in doing so reveal the steps that shape the national memories of those who struggle to come to terms with traumatic loss. This volume focuses on the hybrid quality of these temporary memorials as both monuments of mourning and as focal points for protest and expression of discontent. The broad range of case studies in this volume include anti-mafia shrines, Theo van Gogh's memorial, September 11th memorials, March 11th shrines in Madrid, and Carlo Giuliani memorials in Genoa.</p>

                     <p>On 13 October 2008, the initial global economic crash had just occurred, and people everywhere seemed to be in a state of shock about what had happened to the world. In the City of London, a memorial was created on a lamppost in front of the Bank of England. It was constructed with flowers, stuffed animals, and crosses and topped with a plaque representing a circle of bleeding roses and the text “In Loving Memory of the Boom Economy.” Letters were attached expressing grievances about what had happened and what was yet to come, like “R.I.P., Rest in Poverty.” It</p>

At 5:58 PM on 23 May 1992, a section of the expressway between Palermo and Puntaraisi airport, near the hamlet of Capaci, blew up, killing judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife, judge Francesca Morvillo, and three members of their police escort. The section that blew up had been packed with explosives by a Mafia commando.</p>

                     <p>Shortly after 9:00 on Tuesday morning, 2 November 2004, my husband called me at my office to tell me that he had just heard on the radio that a man had been shot on Linnaeusstraat in Amsterdam, and that the victim was probably Theo van Gogh. It was uncertain whether or not van Gogh—if the announcement indeed concerned him—had survived the attack. Within an hour, however, all uncertainty was gone: Van Gogh, a well-known Dutch film director and provocative publicist on the issue of Islam and immigration, was dead. The killer, a man in Muslim attire, had been</p>

                     <p>The death of any individual strikes at the hearts of the living. Family and friends mourn a lost life; a community recognizes a permanent loss. If a death is thought to have been needless—or worse, politically motivated—mourning may well take on the trappings of public protest. Along with the official rituals of church and state, we often see, as the editors of this volume suggest, a kind of “grassroots memorialization,” in which individuals are mourned as a form of social action. When the causes of death are objectionable, foreseeable, or avoidable, people often mourn publicly in protest (Margry</p>

                     <p>In the past twenty-five years, the custom has developed to memorialize victims of tragedy and disaster by the creation of spontaneous shrines or performative memorials at or near the site, which has today become so common that Erica Doss calls the phenomenon “memorial mania” (Doss 2008b). Because of the emotional intensity of the context in which they are created, these shrines express the immediate prevailing local worldview. Generally, they are anonymous, communal creations that conform to community standards and mores. As one researcher remarked about the Columbine shrines, “Memorials are only as powerful as the community they seek to honor</p>

                     <p>In August 1991, nine-year-old Nicola Seher was run over and killed in Hamburg by a truck whose driver had failed to spot a set of red traffic lights. What could have been an inconspicuous accident developed into a two-week protest against traffic policy. People gathered at the site of the accident, most of them silent, some crying, some talking to each other. They laid such objects as candles and flowers on the road, and some expressed their determination to stay there, or to return the following day, to demand political change. They were both mourning the deceased and protesting; this</p>

                     <p>In October 2003, the first “ghost bike” appeared in St. Louis, Missouri, to memorialize the death of a cyclist who had been hit by a car. A local bicycle shop owner witnessed the accident and placed a mangled bike, painted stark white, on the scene, with a sign proclaiming “Cyclist struck here.” The movement quickly spread beyond St. Louis, and similar memorials have since appeared in thirty other cities across North and South America, Europe, and Australia, creating a network of mourners and activists who are working to increase vehicular awareness of bicyclists. The sudden popularity of ghost bike memorials</p>

                     <p>Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005. Two days later, the largest Polish newspaper—<italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic>—published a commemorative text written by Father Tadeusz Bartoś, a Dominican theologian of the younger generation who is known for his open approach to the questions that are usually silenced in the conservative Polish church.¹ In his article of 4 April 2005, titled “The Last Great Romantic,” Bartoś writes:</p>
                     <p>This Pope is an icon of our recent history. He was an outstanding example in the age of spiritual battle. He was our voice when the Poles were condemned to silence; he was</p>

                     <p>In societies that experience catastrophic events, numerous practices are aimed at endowing those events with meaning. The contingent nature of a catastrophe and the disorder it creates are inconsistent with the human sense of reason and provoke anxiety. To overcome the anxiety and limit the disorder, societies generally seek to reestablish order by explaining the catastrophe and by evaluating it, narrating it, commemorating it, and trying to prevent its repetition. All of these processes enable people to deal actively with the disorienting event and to convert disorder into order (Balandier 1988).</p>

                     <p>First, I would like to put forward a general hypothesis that is, I think, corroborated by the various recent scholarly studies on grassroots memorials and spontaneous shrines. This phenomenon can be called a “new culture of disaster,” and it is currently shared by large numbers of people around the world. Beyond the specificity of each society, history, and religion, when a catastrophe strikes, people seem to draw on the same repertory of actions. For centuries, we have shared a common political activism in the form of demonstrations and strikes (Tilly 1986). But the public culture of disaster seems different for</p>

                     <p>For more than a hundred years, anthropologists and psychologists have dealt with the role of collective mourning and the analysis of the roots of emotions. Although emotions are central for the understanding of grassroots memorials, emotions themselves are rarely the focus of research on the topic. At the same time, there is a clear social demand for the interpretation of emotions in order to, for example, understand the instrumentalizations that emotions can be the subject of in times of conflict and social unrest. In the acts of mourning performed at grassroots memorials, the emotions at play cover a wide range,</p>

The first attack was perpetrated shortly after eleven at night in Paddy’s Bar, a pub visited mainly by Westerners, by a suicide bomber wearing a jacket lined with explosives. The second incident occurred a few minutes later: A Mitsubishi van filled with ammunition blew up across the street from Paddy’s outside the Sari Club, a nightclub</p>

The memory of major events tends to crystallize, to acquire a fixed frame of interpretations and analysis, suggested by personal feelings and political beliefs. Tragedies, especially when highly shocking, tend to turn into “legendary” narratives, and the more important they are, the harder it becomes to examine them critically. The events of July 2001 in Genoa are already part of a militant legend. The death of Carlo Giuliani during the G8 riots was instantly</p>
