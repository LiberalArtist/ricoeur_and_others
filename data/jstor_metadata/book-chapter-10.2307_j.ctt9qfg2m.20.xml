      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.</p>

                     <p>A magazine reporter once asked Aretha Franklin to define soul.</p>
                     <p>“Soul is black,” Ms. Franklin replied.</p>
                     <p>And she should know. As the reigning Queen of soul, Aretha Franklin’s life attests to that sweet sensuality that lends power to the voice, spirit to the body and depth to understanding. Soul is the stuff of our dreams and marks that magical domain of powerful nothingness where fantasies and ancestors live. Aimé Cesaire recognized the revolutionary potential of such surrealist manifestations; but at the same time, everybody’s favorite soul-brother-number-one, James Brown, embodies a gritty, gut-wrenching reality which has transcended national boundaries and crossed</p>

                     <p>For a white middle-class child of the seventies, Black Power ran in color on three major networks. Its “power” was ignited on cathode ray tubes or was motored at 33 1/3 r.p.m. I was aware of Stokely Carmichael’s coinage mostly through the sexy-but-safe denizens of<italic>Room 222,</italic>or through downcast, dark-skinned malcontents being preached to by a pious Joe Friday on<italic>Dragnet</italic>. Or, I heard the phrase as anthem-like, its exclamation point coinciding with Sly Stone’s at the end of “Stand!” It was later, in high school, when I learned about the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and how white</p>

                     <p>The “Afro” style of movement and performance began in Brazil in the seventies among radicalized sectors of the Black-mixtured community as a way to recuperate and politicize inherited African cultural practices that had been co-opted by the dictatorship as simply folklore, part of “our Brazilian Heritage.” Twenty years later, it appears that this particular style of dance has a fixed set of codes from which the dancer may construct/choreograph meaning into a performance. This position, however, reinstates the paradigm of the “folk” into a dynamic process of identification, communication, and insertion within transnational discourses about the various cultures of people</p>

                     <p>Not long ago, I attended a performance in San Francisco by women presently or formerly incarcerated in the County Jail, in collaboration with Bay Area women performance artists. After the show, I went backstage to the “green room,” where the women inmates, guarded by deputy sheriffs stationed outside the door, were celebrating with their families and friends. Having worked with some of the women at the jail, I wanted to congratulate them on the show. One woman introduced me to her brother, who at first responded to my name with a blank stare. The woman admonished him: “You don’t know</p>

                     <p>James Baldwin, as a developing essayist and thinker, sought to fashion the Black reaction to anti-Black racism by iterating and reiterating the risk of genuine freedom for whites who refused to relinquish their hatred. Baldwin desired to dissolve the horror of American racism in the crucible of love, and thus pass to his brothers and sisters the cup of understanding. This idea was at the heart of his first collection of essays,<italic>Notes of a Native Son</italic>(1955), which was hailed by many as an enduring view on the Black condition in America. But perhaps the severest criticism was that</p>

                     <p>At the height of his experiment in democratic socialism in the 1970s, Prime Minister Michael Manley coined a stinging retort to those Jamaicans opposed to his government’s restructuring of this Caribbean island’s economy. “We have five flights to Miami every day,” he tartly reminded these disgruntled Jamaicans, the majority of whom were white and Creole. The prime minister’s information about the frequency of flights to Miami was, of course, redundant, since these disaffected citizens were infinitely more familiar than Manley with the plane schedules. However, the Jamaican leader’s contempt for both these malcontents and the U.S. city for which they</p>

Playing with my dense rhyme scheme a tagteam partner in an attempt to marry analysis, opinion, and art. Intense word play is the way we poet types try to understand how we feel. For this artisan, soul is the reflection of culturalists looking for the most alternatives and bearing the most diverse array of accouterments. From my vantage point I see nuanced implications for political direction in Afrofern’s literally abstract articulation.

More than thirty years have elapsed since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of nonviolent protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to confront the racist phalanx of state police troopers defending segregation. The politics of resistance at that turbulent moment in our history gave new meaning to our sense of identity. The politics of soul in the 1960s was the personal and collective decision to fight for</p>

                     <p>Revisiting seventies socialism and soul culture from the vantage point of the United States in the nineties raises important questions about the structures of enjoyment embedded in the anticapitalist stance of many emergent socialist states, such as Tanzania during that turbulent time. Most critiques of seventies socialist cultures readily dismiss socialism as having no soul. The inherent assumption of such critiques is that capitalism is the sole arbiter of enjoyment through free and ideologically uncontaminated flow of consumption. Such binary critiques oversimplify the relationship between state formations and citizens as consumers. These critiques further elide the intricate and nuanced strategies</p>

This is a murky area that serious intellectuals will have to deal with sooner or later.</p>

                     <p>“That boy can flat-out sing,” seventeen-year-old Shanita says to me as she ever so carefully drapes a just-ironed pair of Boss jeans over a wire hanger. And who am I? I’m AnthroMan®, the anthropologist-in-training who is superscientifically stretched out across Shanita’s pecan-sandy colored comforter.¹ I’m engaged in fieldwork on this day (that rite of passage called participant observation) and one of my first tasks as an ethnographer is to discursively render my environment. So I simply sit on the comforter, take in my surroundings, and jot down notes.</p>

Apart from the botanical significance of the rare sprout, the flower’s appeal lies not in its anticipated beauty but rather in its vociferous odor, news of which has permeated the countryside like, well, a putrid stench.

Gilroy’s work has been crucial to our (and others’) critical (re)considerations of soul because it calls for a rigorous investigation of the impact that the exchange of ideas and commodities across various national borders has had on these global communities. Similarly, he calls upon us to interrogate both the differences and commonalities among black diasporic communities in</italic>

                     <p>In a book about soul, a roundtable discussion on race as a critical paradigm in the academy may appear a bit incongruous, a sacrilege even. Academics have fallen under heavy fire for sapping the fun out of everything. From movies and music to the blind security most people feel with their own identities—we nitpick and dissect everything of value into nothingness. And now, after submitting “soul” to our unforgiving knife, we have to throw something about “critical paradigms” into the mix.</p>
                     <p>But soul-searching is second nature to the fledgling Black academic who must constantly reevaluate and second-guess the personal,</p>
