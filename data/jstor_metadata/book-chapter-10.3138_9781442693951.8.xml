                     <p>In his<italic>Defense of Poesy</italic>, Sir Philip Sidney claims that the ‘charming force’ of poetry can lead even ‘hard-hearted evil men’ who enjoy only ‘indulgere genio’ to ‘see the form of goodness (which seen they cannot but love) ere themselves be aware.’<italic>Magical Imaginations</italic>was conceived when I became interested in this claim, particularly in the way it afforded literary pleasure ideological efficacy, as if poetic delight could make resistant readers love ‘goodness’ without alerting them that their dispositions were being disciplined. This intriguing and perhaps disquieting suggestion made me newly curious about Edmund Spenser’s statement that his 1590<italic>Faerie</italic>

                     <p>In a moment that exemplifies his charming critical persona, Sir Philip Sidney ends his 1581 essay of literary theory,<italic>The Defense of Poesy</italic>, by engaging in a witty extended parody. Having argued eloquently for poetry’s cultural value, in his<italic>peroratio</italic>Sidney switches modes, and adopts the self-mocking role of a magician who hyperbolically conjures his readers to believe for true all that he has written:</p>
                     <p>I conjure you all that have had the evil luck to read this ink-wasting toy of mine, even in the name of the Nine Muses, no more to scorn the sacred mysteries of Poesy ...</p>

                     <p>In his 1590<italic>Faerie Queene</italic>, Spenser represents demonic conjuration in terms that could well describe poetic creation. His diabolical magician Archimago, for instance, conjures malevolent spirits using ‘verses’ (1.1.27) from his magic books, and he fashions his spirits to make ‘false showes’ that ‘abuse [the] fantasy’ (1.1.46) of the Redcrosse knight.¹ Indeed, ever since A. Bartlett Giamatti first noticed that the demonic ‘false shewes’ conjured by Archimago’s verses are akin to the imaginative images invoked by Spenser’s poetry, it has become commonplace to read the magician as Spenser’s allegorical figure for the poet. Hence critics generally characterize Archimago and the</p>

                     <p>Like Sidney and Spenser, Marlowe deployed instrumental aesthetics in order to establish his art as a distinct and valued cultural form. Unlike them, however, Marlowe never sought patronage by promising to improve his audiences morally; rather, he attempted to draw people to the Bankside with the charisma of his persona, expanding the market in which theatre arose as an independent institution by staging astonishingly powerful performances whose effects appeared to transcend the disenchanted boundaries that usually frame the experience of a play. Nor did he hesitate to exploit the connection of instrumental aesthetics and magic to achieve his artistic goals.</p>

                     <p>Twentieth-century Shakespeare criticism has bequeathed us a picture of<italic>The Tempest</italic>as a document of early British imperialism.¹ Like the interpretations they serve to contest, postcolonial readings of the play usually view Prospero as an analogue of James or his colonial administrator.² Such readings, though, ignore the historical fact that in his political writings and his legislation James represented magicians as traitors who should be tortured and executed without pardon. In his 1597<italic>Daemonologie</italic>, and again in his 1603<italic>Basilikon Doron</italic>, James explicitly proclaimed that in using powers given to them by devils, magicians undermine the divine sovereignty of the</p>

                     <p>The historical relationship between magical spells called ‘charms’ and literary texts meant to have instrumental effects has emerged repeatedly a leitmotif of this book. The Elizabethan parliament outlawed the practice of charming as a felony in 1563, yet in<italic>The Defense of Poesy</italic>, Sidney characterized poetry’s efficacy as its ‘sweet, charming force.’² A figure for the court poet who attempts to seduce his married beloved with sonnets, Spenser’s Busirane deployed ‘a thousand charms’ to compel Amoret’s love ‘perforce.’³ The Protestants whose account of conjuration Marlowe appropriated for<italic>Doctor Faustus</italic>insisted that any signs used to spiritual ends without scriptural authorization</p>
