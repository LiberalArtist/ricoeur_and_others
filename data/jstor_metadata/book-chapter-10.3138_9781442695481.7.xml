                     <p>This book presents an itinerary of English Catholicism in the early modern period. Imagine you are looking at an interactive map depicting the fortunes of members of the ‘old faith’ – variously called ‘Romanist,’ ‘Romish,’ and ‘papist,’ as well as ‘Catholic’ – in Reformation-era England. Maps tell stories of one kind or another and this one would be in no way different, but the embedded graphs and visual icons would yield a tangle of information not easily reducible to a single story. The machinery of an epic tale would be on display, notably through the sense of heroic antagonism animating the sequence</p>

                     <p>In an Italian-American parish in which I lived for part of my youth, many of the plaster statues of saints, the Virgin, and Christ had feet worn down, mainly by the devout old women who kissed and rubbed them as part of their religious ritual behaviour. Without such touching, their religious experience was impoverished – even if, to some ways of thinking, what they were doing was practising idolatry.</p>

                     <p>This essay is about the uneasy fit between confession and identity at two moments of heightened interest in securing a ‘true and perfect’ relation between the two: the trial of Henry Garnet, supposed confessor to the Gunpowder Plot conspirators in 1606, and the years just after the executions of the popish plot traitors in 1679. Both of the moments I shall discuss are a little after the most intense panic, when the broader consequences of crises began to manifest themselves. Although more than seventy years intervene, we can find in both 1606 and the early 1680s a concern regarding whether</p>

                     <p>As pervasive as it is, change is an exceptionally difficult concept to understand or to accept. We may never step in the same river twice, but life surely is easier both logistically and psychologically if we act as if we do.¹ Religious conversion, at its most fundamental, is change, whether from ‘irreligion to religion; or from one religion to another; or from one denomination to another; or from one theological position to another; or from a second hand to first hand experience of religion.’² A 1604 English dictionary defines the verb<italic>convert</italic>simply with the words<italic>turne</italic>,<italic>change</italic>.³ From the</p>

                     <p>‘A palinode [is] … used of those who change their minds for the better.’¹ This definition, from the<italic>Proverbs</italic>of Macarius, would have sounded familiar to writers in late-sixteenth-century England who explored the themes of repentance, recantation, and conversion. But in cases where these writings mirror or comment upon real-life denominational shifts, readers would have disagreed over whether a change was for the better. This essay explores the early career of the late Elizabethan writer William Alabaster, who underwent religious conversion at least twice, once to Catholicism and once from it, and a spate of sonnet-writing – and probably at least</p>

                     <p>‘Crashaw … possesses style, or he would not deserve the eminent place he holds among our poets.’ So determines Edmund Gosse, writing near the end of the nineteenth century, when Richard Crashaw’s stature as an English poet seemed to be the given that it now no longer is. Gosse further determines that we might describe what style Crashaw has ‘best in negatives’: ‘He is not so warm and real as Herrick, nor so drily intellectual as the other hymnists, nor coldly and respectably virile like Cowley.’ ‘To use an odd simile of Shelley’s,’ Gosse continues, Crashaw ‘sells us gin when</p>

                     <p>In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and</p>

Lord Gordon’s anti-Catholic Protestant Association, seeking the repeal of the Catholic Relief Act of 1778, had whipped up mobs who were roaming the city in search of Catholics.¹ On Friday, 2 June, they ransacked the private chapel of the Sardinian ambassador in Duke Street near Lincoln’s Inn Fields and razed it before moving on to the chapel of the Bavarian embassy in Warwick Street.² The Benedictine sisters from Dunkirk, newly settled at Hammersmith, hastily packed up all their altar plate and entrusted it to a neighbour, who buried it in his garden until</p>

Born in 1593 into a wealthy Catholic family in southeast England, in the 1610s White went ‘beyond the seas’ for his education: in 1616 he arrived at Douai, where he was ordained as a priest and there remained as a professor. Among his students was Henry Holden, who later became a close political and religious collaborator of his. White travelled extensively throughout Europe (in</p>
