                     <p>Writing to her father from the Gurdjieff Institute only weeks before she died, Katherine Mansfield announced delightedly, ‘One very pleasant thing here is that I have to speak Russian consistently and shall I hope get as fluent in it as I am in French and German. After that I should like to rub up my Italian. Languages<italic>fascinate</italic>me.’¹ Even allowing for her putting on a perky voice to please her parents, or perhaps to convince herself that a medical cure could still be found, there is no mistaking the sparkling sincerity when expressing her passion for languages.

                     <p>When Katherine Mansfield first began publishing in<italic>Rhythm</italic>in the spring of 1912, she contributed a short story set in the backblocks of New Zealand, ‘The Woman at the Store’, together with two poems ‘Translated from the Russian of Boris Petrovsky’.¹ These were fake translations, written by Mansfield herself. ‘Boris Petrovsky’ was the first pseudonym Mansfield used in<italic>Rhythm, a nom de plume</italic>that she returned to on four other occasions in the magazine. And the mask continues to trick readers. As recently as 2009, in his chapter on<italic>Rhythm</italic>in the first volume of<italic>The Oxford Critical and Cultural</italic>

                     <p>The two expressions in the title of this paper illustrate the extremities of the range of problems translators struggle with on their journey to a final text. ‘Ginger whiskers’ represent for me all the unpleasant yet unavoidable losses of meaning, the moments when one has to give up and admit defeat; ‘Glad-eyes’, on the other hand, is one of those elements that yield easily and let themselves be translated in a creative way while keeping the meaning and beauty of the original text. In between, there are instances of further or closer approximations between two languages which not only differ</p>

                     <p>Between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a transition occurred in modern fiction as writers became increasingly reliant on the visual. In his study<italic>Fiction and the Camera Eye</italic>, Alan Spiegel argues that this new visual consciousness in the novel was symptomatic of the shift from a theological to a scientific understanding of the world, meaning that, in modern fiction, ‘truth’ can only be revealed through sensory experience rather than authorial intervention.¹ In an uncertain modern world, Spiegel suggests, an author is no longer an authority; the common practice of pausing action in the novel to allow for exposition was</p>

                     <p>In the early nineteenth century, Schleiermacher noted that ‘understanding is an unending task’ and ‘the talent for misunderstanding is infinite’.² In more recent times, meaning has been understood as an endless deferral; the more one tries to grasp it, the more it appears ungraspable. This rings especially true if we consider the particular form of understanding that is translation. Since the meaning of a text is closely attached to its ‘letter’ – its sound or signifier – translation can never be a simple transfer of meaning. Indeed, no matter how accurately one brings meaning ‘home’,³ the result is inevitably approximate,</p>

                     <p>On 19 February 1915, Katherine Mansfield made her way by train from Paris to Gray to meet the French author, Francis Carco. He had been stationed there during World War One, and after making his acquaintance via John Middleton Murry, Mansfield believed herself to be in love with him. According to Antony Alpers, it was the discovery in Murry’s notebook of the ‘confess[ion] to Gordon Campbell that he didn’t know whether she was “more to him than a gratification”’, which finally led Mansfield to make her daring trip to France.¹ By the time she had taken him as her lover,</p>

                     <p>In Notebook 2 – often called the ‘Urewera Notebook’ – Katherine Mansfield quotes the end of Gustave Flaubert’s July 1852 letter to his best friend, Maxime du Camp. She copied the phrase ‘Nous ne suivons plus la même route, nous ne naviguons plus dans la même nacelle. Moi je ne cherche pas le port, mais la haute mer.’¹ Flaubert follows these lines with one short, pithy phrase which Mansfield did not reproduce in her notebook but which must have resonated with how she viewed her position in 1908 as she planned to embark on an artistic career: ‘If I am</p>

                     <p>Mansfield’s relationship with France is expressed in many different ways in her short stories, one of which is the fundamental role played by the French language. Mansfield confronts English-speaking readers with a foreign language that constantly interacts with their mother tongue, creating an intriguing tension between the two languages, both of which are unsettled as a result, and lose their familiarity. This tension puzzles native speakers, whether French or English, albeit through different processes; the title of one of her most famous stories, ‘Je ne parle pas français’, through its very paradoxical nature, epitomises the issue of the interaction between</p>

                     <p>Following Katherine Mansfield’s death in 1923, critical reviews of her work started to appear in France, fuelling an interest which concentrated primarily on her life and personal writing, and only secondarily on her fiction. This thirst for biographical detail gave impetus to the translations of the<italic>Letters</italic>and<italic>Journal</italic>in 1931 and 1932 (which had first appeared in English in 1928 and 1927, respectively). Within the space of a few years, translations of various volumes of her stories were also published. In this essay, I shall highlight how the translations of her fiction have, for the most part, diluted her</p>

The sun caught the old town first, its jumble of faded pastels glowing like the gilded ceilings of the Vatican – yellow, pink, rose, white, red, orange, grey and cadmium; medieval plasterwork rising joyously from the silky sea as it had done for more centuries than she could even comprehend.</p>
                     <p>Next the light would hit the mountains up beyond, their dark wooded valleys and bare silver rock-faces diffused behind the daily haze of early morning cloud. By ten the cloud would burn away, heat smothering the land with a shimmer of dry-roasted air.</p>

I was flipping through the letters which had arrived with the morning post when I was startled by my wife’s voice. She had a way of moving as if her feet didn’t touch the ground and could enter a room without sound. This was something I liked about her when we first met, but recently this characteristic had been making me cagey. ‘You don’t mind, do you? Having another guest?’ she asked. I shook my head and circled my arm about</p>

But there was no sadness in that, for down below there was such fine green of so many vibrantly different kinds, and so many sturdy boughs and trunks beneath that, silver sinews and august umbers, some gymnastically betrothed, some straight and stoic. And there were rivers, sparking and</p>

                     <p>Behind this playful, exuberant image,¹ celebrating Lady Ottoline Morrell and her court at Garsington, lie complex emotions. At an early age, Dorothy Brett had suffered from hearing problems. It first became noticeable while she was a student at the Slade School of Art, then, as now, part of University College, London. The Provost of this prestigious institution, horrified by the fact that Brett and two friends had chosen to picnic on the hallowed lawn inside the courtyard, delivered a severe reprimand. ‘I’m sorry, I’m deaf,’ Brett replied, ‘I haven’t been able to hear a word you said.’²</p>
