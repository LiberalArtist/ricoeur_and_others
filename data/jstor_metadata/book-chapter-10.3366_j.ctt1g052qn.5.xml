                     <p>Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault are widely accepted to be central figures of post-war French philosophy. Foucault (1926–84) held a chair in the History of Systems of Thought at the prestigious Collège de France, and remains one of the most-cited authors in the humanistic disciplines. Deleuze (1925–95), who taught at the University of Paris-St Denis until his retirement in 1987, authored more than twenty-five books, and was one of the most important and influential European philosophers of the post-war period. Cultural theorists, historians, philosophers and others have devoted considerable effort to the critical examination of the work of</p>

                     <p>“Perhaps one day this century will be known as Deleuzian.”¹ Michel Foucault’s lucid remark, made in 1969, has often been repeated. As for Deleuze, “Gilles deeply admired Michel Foucault.”² Although they saw each other frequently and fought alongside each other for the same political causes, they never really worked together. Yet as the final tributes were being paid to Foucault at La Salpêtrière before a crowd of several hundred mourners, it was Deleuze who stood and read an excerpt from the preface to<italic>The Use of Pleasure</italic>. Some basic disagreements were surely motivated by a certain rivalry as to who</p>

I believe that these words will continue to revolve about us in enigmatic resonance with those of Klossowski, another major and excessive sign, and perhaps one day, this century will be known as Deleuzian.</p>
                     <p>One after another, I should like to explore the many paths that lead to the heart of these challenging tests. As Deleuze has said</p>

                     <p>Foucault refers to his work as “studies in history,” though he does not see it as “the work of an historian.” He does the work of a philosopher, but he does not work on the philosophy of history. What does it mean to think? Foucault has never dealt with any other problem (hence his debt to Heidegger). And the historical? It is formations which are stratified, made up of strata. But to think is to reach a non-striated material, somewhere between the layers, in the interstices. Thinking has an essential relation to history, but it is no more historical than</p>

Foucault’s latest work had been<italic>Discipline and Punish</italic>, translated into Italian in 1976. At that time, I had begun to work again on Marx,</p>

                     <p>In a 1972 conversation concerning the role of philosophy in the work of social critique, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze put forward a conception of critical theory that resonates widely throughout the varied terrains of their work. At the heart of the conception they constructed together in “Intellectuals and Power” is a radical revisioning of the work that philosophy should expect of itself insofar as philosophy can legitimately expect itself to engage present social, cultural, ethical and political problems. Foucault and Deleuze clearly expected such engagements of themselves. Much of their work is located, in different ways of course, at</p>

                     <p>We will explore the Deleuzian nature of Foucault’s differential historical methodology in the mid-to-late 1970s. We will track formulations that suggest the key concept of<italic>Difference and Repetition:</italic>individuation as the integrating of a differential field or “multiplicity.”¹</p>
                     <p>In<italic>Discipline and Punish</italic>(1975), Foucault uses “war” (or at least “battle”) as a “model” for understanding social relations:</p>
                     <p>Now, the study of this micro-physics presupposes that the power exercised on the body is conceived not as a property, but as a strategy, that its effects of domination are attributed not to ‘appropriation,’ but to dispositions, maneuvers, tactics, techniques, functionings; that one</p>

                     <p>Before all else, we need to acknowledge a previously held, reprehensible position: for a long time Deleuze’s book on Foucault² seemed to consist of a dogmatic rigidity that did not manage to break into the enthusiasm of what Foucault said. From cover to cover the book seemed<italic>ridiculous</italic>to us. It seemed far, so far from Foucault’s actual work, and with a menacing sort of passion we thought about<italic>demonstrating</italic>that in his book Deleuze had committed nothing more than a work of fiction. The reception of Deleuze’s presentation at the conference, “Michel Foucault, Philosopher,”³ only reinforced these poorly conceived</p>

                     <p>Deleuze returned often to the “admiration” and “affection” he felt for Foucault.¹ In the 1970s, he began to present Foucault as the contemporary philosopher who had done the most to reframe the question of history. Coming from a philosopher who insists so much on the opposition between becoming and history, this admiration invites notice. Deleuze, like Foucault, but also with him, and while discovering his thought, confronts this new way of dealing with empirical historicity: to take it epistemologically, in the form of the archive, without, for all that, renouncing the critique of linear chronology and of teleological or causal</p>

Accordingly, I want to explore here just one element of this engagement: the decisive role played by Deleuze’s critique of the traditional representationalist image of thought and his proposal for a discordant accord of thinking – one that would, as he</p>

This was his 1985 work,<italic>Foucault</italic>(Paris: Les Éditions de Minuit), a collection of six separate pieces on the work of Michel Foucault (1926–84).¹ Although scarcely more than 130 pages long, the slim volume was immediately hailed as an indisputable reference for all interested in Foucault’s thought.

                     <p>In the introductory chapter of<italic>Dits et Ecrits</italic>(Chronology), Daniel Defert reminds us of a joke between Foucault and Deleuze. In March 1972, soon after the publication of<italic>Anti-Oedipus</italic>, Foucault tells to his friend: “We have to get rid of Freudo-Marxism.”¹ To which Deleuze replies, “I’m taking care of Freud, will you deal with Marx?”² The revival of the concept of desire in the first volume of<italic>Capitalism and Schizophrenia</italic>represents to a certain extent not simply a radical critique of psychoanalysis and of the ‘Oedipus complex’, but maybe also Deleuze’s part of the bargain with his long-time friend.</p>

                     <p>What is the relationship between Foucault’s concept of biopower and Deleuze’s concept of control? Despite the similarities between these two concepts, there is not a single scholarly article that solely thematizes this question, nor a comparative survey of the answers given so far. This essay aims to fill this lacuna. Despite the lack of a full-length interrogation of this question, scholars have taken up several different positions on the relationship between these two concepts. While some distinguish the two concepts based on the content of what they act on (biopower on life vs control on economics), others distinguish them based</p>

                     <p>In a letter Deleuze addressed to Foucault in 1977, shortly after the publication of the first volume on<italic>The History of Sexuality</italic>(and which has since been published under the title “Desire and Pleasure”), Deleuze laid out several distinctions between his own philosophical trajectory and Foucault’s, one of which concerns, precisely, the status of Foucault’s concept of<italic>resistance</italic>. “It seems to me that Michel confronts a problem that does not have the same status for me,” Deleuze wrote.</p>

                     <p>I must have sent him a letter; Deleuze’s response was rapid and welcoming. Can one imagine Deleuze and Foucault in the age of e-mail? This was not long after the death of Foucault and Deleuze’s loss and remorse were already clear. Finding his apartment not far from Clichy was easy although this section of Montmartre was not one that one thought of as being inhabited by painters and intellectuals in the late twentieth century. He greeted us warmly with his gravelly voice. I can’t remember if we shook hands as Deleuze had these long finger nails and such a gesture</p>

I have no memory; it is like trying to describe a dream; it’s rather vague. After ’68, there were many groups, very different groups, but necessarily compact ones. It was post-68. They survived; they all had a past. Foucault insisted on the fact that ’68 had no importance for him. He already had a history as an important philosopher, but he was not burdened with a history from ’68. That is probably what allowed him to form such a new type</p>
