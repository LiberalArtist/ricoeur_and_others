         <p>This new textbook addresses the neglect of practical research methods in cultural studies. It provides readers with clearly written overviews of research methods in cultural studies, along with guidelines on how to put these methods into operation. It advocates a multi-method approach, with students drawing from a pool of techniques and approaches suitable for their own topics of investigation.</p>
         <p>The book covers the following main areas:</p>
         <p>Drawing on experience, and studying how narratives make sense of experience.Investigating production processes in the cultural industries, and the consumption and assimilation of cultural products by audiences and fans.Taking both quantitative and qualitative approaches to the study of cultural life.Analysing visual images and both spoken and written forms of discourse.Exploring cultural memory and historical representation.</p>
         <p>Key Features</p>
         <p>A unique guide to research methods in Cultural StudiesExplores key methods of research, with examples of how to pursue (or not to pursue) a particular method.Expert contributors include Martin Barker, Aeron Davis, David Deacon, Emily Keightley, Steph Lawler, Anneke Meyer, Virginia Nightingale and Sarah Pink.</p>

                     <p>There has long been a reluctance to bring any explicit discussion of methods and methodology into cultural studies. This can be explained in various ways. We can see it first of all as connected with the fieldâ€™s renegade character, and its conscious dissociation from established academic disciplines. Developing and adhering to a particular set of methods was considered to be characteristic of those disciplines and somehow compromised by an unexamined notion of empirical enquiry. Cultural studies has preferred to borrow techniques and methods from established disciplines without subscribing to any disciplinary credentials itself. Empirical enquiry has been treated with suspicion</p>

                     <p>Experience is central to cultural studies. It is a key category of analysis within the field, and has been drawn on as concrete material for many of the issues which cultural studies has pursued. It has also become a recognised dimension of research practice itself. Its value has nevertheless been contested, both as a form of research data and as an analytical concept. This was particularly the case during the ascendancy of poststructuralism in cultural studies, but more broadly how it should be used as a resource and what place it has as evidence are questions that have generated considerable</p>

                     <p>As Barbara Hardy, among others, has noted, narratives are integral to social life (1975). People continually tell stories to themselves and to others, gathering up fragments of the day to make a coherent whole, or fragments of occurrences in a life to make a coherent life story. Even though most people will not write autobiographies, all of us are engaged in the projects of our own autobiography, which we manifest every time we tell others about our lives, attend an interview, or simply engage in processes of thinking about and understanding the world and our place within it. In all</p>

                     <p>This chapter is in four parts. Each of the first three parts offers a brief overview of the more common research approaches used to investigate cultural production. These are broadly categorised here as political economy, textual analysis and sociological/ethnographic work. The fourth part then concentrates on the third of these and the practical considerations involved. In both parts the discussion and examples draw on my own experiences of researching cultural production in the news industry and within the subcultures of financial and political elite networks. At the time of writing I have interviewed over 250 professionals employed in journalism, public</p>

                     <p>Consumption in its many forms is not a new phenomenon (Storey 1999), but since the end of the Second World War, consumption in industrialised countries has proliferated to such an extent that the phrase â€˜consumer societyâ€™ was coined. Arguably,<italic>cultural</italic>consumption has especially increased because technological advances have led to the development and spread of new forms of media and information and communication technologies (ICTs).

                     <p>I arrived at David and Anneâ€™s house one morning in autumn 2005, to interview them about the community garden project David was involved in. I was ready with the tool kit of a contemporary visual researcher: digital video and stills cameras, audio recorder, and pen and notebook. My research involved photography, audio-recording our interview and collaboratively exploring the garden site with David on video. It also led me to attend closely to the visual elements of the project itself. When I interview people about their experiences, projects and passions, they usually pull out visual images with which to tell me</p>

                     <p>The seemingly inexorable rise of the concept of â€˜discourseâ€™ has made it almost unavoidable for cultural studies researchers, particularly since its invitation to theorise culture as â€˜like a languageâ€™ coincides with so many impulses within our field. But not without substantial costs. Looking at the cultural studies field from my angle as an audience researcher, some troubling features within discourse work come into view. For all the multiplicity of approaches, and the attendant variations in attached modes of â€˜discourse analysisâ€™, there are some powerful unifying features in â€˜discourse talkâ€™; and these features presume the<italic>very things</italic>that as an audience</p>

                     <p>Memory has enjoyed a well charted resurgence in the postwar period in cultural production, social life and academic study (see Huyssen 2000; Misztal 2003; Radstone 2000). The social dislocations that occurred in the aftermath of the world wars, and the radical trauma of the Holocaust, threw into sharp relief issues of remembrance and commemoration (Wolf 2004; Margalit 20002). In more recent years, a growing disillusionment with the rhetoric of progress which has been so central to modernity has required a reconsideration of pasts that had been hurriedly discarded. At this historical juncture memory is becoming an increasingly key feature of</p>

                     <p>Engaging with history is a popular experience. It is popular in the sense that it is widespread and has huge appeal. It involves a variety of activities that include visiting museums and heritage sites, watching history programmes on television, collecting antiques and compiling a family history. Over the past thirty years, the development of popular interest in the past, in these and many other ways, has grown up alongside the development in academic life of a sceptical questioning of the value of historical enquiry and a drastic suspicion about the very grounds on which history is represented. There is a</p>
