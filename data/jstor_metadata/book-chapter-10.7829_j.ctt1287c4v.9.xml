      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.</p>

                     <p>The most remarkable thing about the spontaneous street demonstrations in different Bulgarian cities in February 2013 was not their surprising (and totally unexpected) success in toppling the center-right government of Boiko Borisov, but two features that made them unique: the demography of the protesters and their slogans. The crowd was mostly composed of young people, university and high-school students in their teens, and there was an almost complete avoidance of political sloganeering. The protests started over the high electricity bills, but were generally directed against the corruption of the political class, the arrogance of the<italic>nouveaux riches</italic>, and the abject</p>

                     <p>The revolutions that swept Europe in 1989 were unexpected, not only for historians. Their commemoration twenty years later has prompted an enormous output of publications in all formats and genres: books, DVDs, TV features, and exhibitions covering all segments of culture, from highbrow to lowbrow, state-subsidized and commercial, in the capitals and in the provinces, from academic historiography to dilettante folk art. While the exact number is difficult to verify, up to 60,000 books dealing with the German division and East Germany’s past have been published in the last twenty years. The bulk of these publications is not scholarly literature,</p>

                     <p>According to the conventional knowledge developed in the West during the Cold War, Romania was more often than not an exception, at odds not only with the Soviet Union, but also with the other satellites. From a country envied by the “fraternal” states and applauded by the opposite camp because of its reorientation toward the West in the 1960s, Romania turned by the end of the 1980s into a discredited dictatorship with a rotten economy and the lowest living standards in Europe, with the possible exception of Albania. At the time when perestroika and glasnost stirred the winds of change</p>

                     <p>This chapter begins with a few words on the evolution of the historiographical interpretations of the socialist era in Bulgaria. The shift occurred almost immediately after 1989. Unlike some other socialist countries in Eastern Europe, in Bulgaria “the changes” were not the result of a “people’s revolution” but rather “a palace coup,” whereby the pro-Gorbachev group in the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party forced Todor Zhivkov to resign.¹ As a result, the transition process developed more slowly. Still, the reinterpretation of the recent past started on an absolutely negative note: all newspapers (even before</p>

                     <p>Historical studies of the period of the Polish People’s Republic (PRL) flourished after 1989 as a result of the newly gained freedom of scholarship and better access to the archives, as well as growing individual, public, and political interest in this topic. A vast number of books, papers, and memoirs have been published. However, a few valuable books dealing with communist history were published before 1989, either as samizdat in Poland, or abroad. While the communist period (1945–1989) itself has a broad bibliography, the issue of remembering communism¹ is less explored. This chapter is a modest attempt to explore</p>

I could not predict, then, that things would get much worse, to such an extent that, between 1987 and 1989, when I was back in Timişoara, sugar, butter, oil, and flour were rationed, while milk, eggs, and meat implied the same endless queues, before they would disappear altogether from Romanian stores.

I had to hear innumerable egregious mistakes in my classes, for example, a student once saying that communism was “a medieval event or regime” (it was not a metaphorical statement). About five years ago another student wrote in a paper the following sentence: “Nowadays, as we enter the era of</italic>

                        <italic>Adoption is a sore subject, much discussed and debated in present-day Bulgaria. Under socialism, it was a state policy, not subject to public deliberation. Until a decade ago, the ethnological interpretation of adoption was limited to traditional societal norms and perceptions. It was my personal involvement in this process, as well as the lack of serious sociological studies on the socialist period, that engaged my scholarly interest to the topic.</italic>

                        <italic>In my study, I have tried to overcome the one-sided image of communism/socialism in Bulgaria. I hope that it answers some of the critical questions about the development of Bulgarian society in the twentieth century, and that it presents a complex picture of both peasants and workers in the region of Pernik at that time, in particular with regard to the problems of economic and social modernization of Bulgarian society in the period of communism/socialism. The social inequalities between peasants and workers, the focus on industrialization and massive migration to the town—a process typical for the whole communist period</italic>

The aim of presenting this paradox is to draw attention to the condition of industrial workers in socialism and its representation after the fall of the regime.

                        <italic>For more than thirty years my research focus has been on Bulgarian culture in the second half of the twentieth century. In the last twenty years I branched out from the archive and literary works into the sprawling memoir literature, and I have been conducting interviews with Bulgarian intellectuals. I cannot recall whether my choice for interviews was based on the fact of my personal acquaintance with writers, or whether I was attracted to critical authors and their literature. Most likely, the two coincided.</italic>

                        <italic>My childhood went under the sign of socialism. A child perceives but does not rationalize. So my memories of socialism were later imported from family members’ stories. Most of these stories tended to repudiate the past; others were nostalgic, but there was always a before and an after. When my academic adviser, Prof. Natalia Hristova, approached me with a proposal to take part in the project, I responded from the position of someone who has both witnessed an event and is unable to recollect it. I decided to eschew the notion of collective memory in favor of subjective memories— multiple</italic>

I was interested in those questions, being myself a student of socialism, and especially as a result of my participation in a project at the Institute of History at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 2004–2005. The project dealt with how “the changes” reflected upon the discipline of history in the 1980s. The emphasis was on the</italic>

I involved myself in the turmoil only on 22 December, after I heard on TV that Ceauşescu had fled in a helicopter from the party headquarters in Bucharest. A fresh engineer in the city of Tîrgovişte, I remember that before this critical moment I merely anticipated that I was about to experience the worst face of the regime, which seemed to be preparing a large-scale repression.

This special state holiday would be appropriately marked by a rally and festive gatherings in central parts of cities and villages, and it also provided the occasion for guest visits between relatives living at distant locations. In the overall uniformity of lifestyles and consumption patterns, the holiday lunches and dinners hardly varied much and customarily involved meatballs and sausages, tomato salads or mashed potatoes, lemonade and homemade desserts.

At the same time, I have always been aware that the “revival process,” even though it ended in December 1989, is still present as a painful memory.
