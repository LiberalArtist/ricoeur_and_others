The "Wisconsin School" has provided much information on the attitudes of business,
farm, labor, and other social organizations. See, for example, Thomas J. McCormick, China
Market: America's Quest for Informal Empire, 1893-1901 (Chicago, 1967); Lloyd Gardner, Economic
Aspects of New Deal Diplomacy (Madison, 1964); Walter LaFeber, The Cambridge History of Ameri-
can Foreign Relations, Vol. 2, The American Search for Opportunity, 1865-1913 (New York, 1993);
and Patrick J. Hearden, Independence and Empire: The New South's Cotton Mill Campaign, 1865-
1901 (Dekalb, IL, 1982). For similar work outside of the Wisconsin School see, for example,
Joan Hoff Wilson, American Business and Foreign Policy, 1920-1933 (Lexington, KY, 1971); and
William H. Becker, The Dynamics of Business-Government Relations: Industry and Exports, 1893-
1921 (Chicago, 1982). For ethnicity see, for example, Morrell Heald and Lawrence S. Kaplan,
eds., Culture and Diplomacy: The American Experience (Westport, CT, 1970); Louis L. Gerson,
The Hyphenate in Recent American Politics and Diplomacy (Lawrence, KS, 1964); Edward Cuddy,
Irish-American and National Isolationism, 1914-1920 (New York, 1976); Wilson D. Miscamble,

Vote, and the Creation of Israel (Stanford, 1974); and Lorraine Lees, "National Security and

I am indebted to the insightful work of Emily Rosenberg and Frank Costigliola. See,
for example, Rosenberg, "Gendered Discourses in Dollar Diplomacy," and Costigliola, "The
Nuclear Family: Cold War Gendered Discourse in the Western Alliance," both papers deliv-
ered at the Annual Meeting of the Organization of American Historians, 1993. One might
argue that gendered analysis of international relations should do more, that is to explain why
women everywhere are treated unequally. See Sarah Brown, "Feminism, International
Theory, and International Relations of Gender Inequality," Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 17 (1988): 461-75. But Brown makes no effort to show that the structure of international
relations is, in fact, responsible for the situation she abhors.</mixed-citation>

For the disregard of context see Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob, Telling the Truth About
History, 207-31 • The stress on "how" rather than "why," on process rather than causation, on
identity and knowledge rather than interests and needs is embedded in the new criticism based
on culture, gender, and rhetoric. See also Joan Wallach Scott, Gender and the Politics of History

generated mistaken images. Although their argument contrasts with the one I am making here,
it is interesting to note that Chinese and American misperceptions were akin to one another
and that both governments faced difficult constraints, leading the authors to emphasize the
overall "complexity" of the situation.</mixed-citation>

The Cold War International History Project, housed at the Woodrow Wilson Interna-
tional Center in Washington, DC, has cosponsored three major conferences on the origins of
the Cold War during the last two years. The papers given were based on the newly accessible
materials in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Germany. In my view, the papers underscore the
difficulty of making any clear-cut generalizations about the motives and objectives of the Soviet
Union. These papers may be obtained from Jim Hershberg, the director of the Cold War
International History Project. The emerging literature on the Korean War based on Russian,
Chinese, and Korean sources also underscores that new archival evidence will not resolve old
controversies but will enrich them and direct them along new and interesting lines. See, for
example, Bruce Cumings, Roaring of the Cataract; Shu Guang Zhang, Deterrence and Strategic
Culture: Chinese-American Confrontations, tiyqg-iyyH (Ithaca, 1992); Goncharov, Lewis, and
Litai, Uncertain Partners; Hunt, "Beijing and the Korean Crisis"; Chen, "China's Changing

In their recent article, J. Arch Getty, Gabor T. Rittersporn, and Viktor N. Zemskov
present low estimates of victims in Stalin's penal camps, but they do not address the appalling
consequences of collectivization, starvation, resettlement, and mass murder during World War
II. See "Victims of the Soviet Penal System in the Pre-War Years: A First Approach on the
Basis of Archival Evidence," The American Historical Review 98 (October 1993): 1017-49; for
Stalin's crimes see, for example, Robert Conquest, The Great Terror: A Reassessment (New York,
1990); Anton Antonov-Ovseyenko, The Time of Stalin: Portrait of a Tyranny, trans. George
Saunders (New York, 1983); Dmitri Volkogonov, Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy, ed. and trans.

One of my basic disagreements with John Gaddis is his tendency to equate Soviet
repression at home with Soviet expansion abroad. American officials, I want to emphasize,
were concerned with the latter much more than the former. They focused more attention on
Soviet power than on Stalin's contempt for human rights. Although I do think that Stalin
wanted control over his periphery and over German and Japanese power, the nature of the
control was initially quite vague and did not necessarily mean "complete insecurity for every-
one else," as Gaddis argues, although it did mean repression and circumscribed autonomy
(especially in the realm of foreign relations) for many neighboring countries. Gaddis, "Tragedy
of Cold War History," 10.</mixed-citation>

These generalizations can be supported by reference to a vast literature, but I particu-
larly recommend two of Christopher Thome's last books, Border Crossings; and The Issue of War:
States, Societies, and the Far Eastern Conflict (London, 1985). The opening pages of Thomas G.
Paterson's On Every Front: The Making of the Cold War (New York, 1979) still provide a wonder-
ful glimpse of the devastation and dislocation wrought by World War II.</mixed-citation>
