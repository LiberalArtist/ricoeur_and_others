         <abstract>
            <p>The attentions given to textual production in composition scholarship have led to a neglect of the dynamics of textual reception. Renewed acquaintance with the discipline of hermeneutics will provide scholars and instructors with a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between interpretive processes and rhetorical strategies. Building on the work of Phelps, Mailloux, and Crusius, this article revisits Gadamer and Ricoeur, two of the more prominent scholars of modern hermeneutics, for the purpose of applying their principles to learning objectives and class assignments in college-level writing courses.</p>

Iser's approach focuses primarily on aesthetic considerations in reading, but he does combine
his focus with attention to epistemological and ontological considerations. He describes the "wander-
ing viewpoint" in detail: "The switch of viewpoints brings about a spotlighting of textual perspec-
tives, and those in turn become reciprocally influenced backgrounds which endow each new
foreground with a specific shape and form. As the viewpoint changes again, this foreground merges
into the background, which it has modified and which is now to exert its influence on yet another new
foreground. Every articulate reading moment entails a switch of perspective, and this constitutes an
inseparable combination of differentiated perspectives, foreshortened memories, and future expecta-
tions. Thus ... the synthesizing operations of the wandering viewpoint enable the text to pass through
the reader's mind as an ever-expanding work of connections" (116).</mixed-citation>

Timothy Crusius asserts that traditional hermeneutics separates the reader as subject and the
text as object, with the dichotomy providing a framework for understanding hermeneutics. Following
Husserl and Heidegger, Crusius calls this dichotomy into question: "The subject side, then, of the
subject-object dichotomy is neither primary nor self-aware. It cannot be what it claims to be: apart
from the world, whereas it is always in the middle of things; isolated, whereas it is always more
collective and social than individual" (6).</mixed-citation>

Crusius describes the concept of "thrownness" as follows: "We are thrown by the circum-
stances of birth into the life-world of our time and place. This life-world—not the neutral world of
science, objectified into observable objects and processes—is tradition, Being, an evolving horizon of
meanings that prestructures everything we encounter. It makes us to a much greater degree than we
make it; we are always already living a preinterpreted existence, long before any capacity for
sustained critique develops and still for the most part after the onset of mature judgment" (24).</mixed-citation>

Gadamer points out that "modern scholars ... see the tragic as extra-aesthetic, an ethical and
metaphysical phenomenon that enters the sphere of aesthetic problems only from the outside" (129,
