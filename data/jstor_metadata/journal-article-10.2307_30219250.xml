"Why Ethical
Criticism," Booth provides a brief summary of his position: "It is from such disagreements that the
most productive literary criticism can emerge. When undertaken seriously, neither side is likely to
feel fully victorious. Both sides will have learned something overlooked, either about the work itself
or about the world of ethical values in which we all live. And both sides, whether in reading the work
or discussing it, are undergoing the ethical growth that serious encounters with such conflict can pro-
duce" (27, my emphasis)</mixed-citation>
