         <title>Then And Now</title>
         <p>For this fiftieth anniversary of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), my idea is to characterize the association then and now in terms of an actual trajectory of learning, thinking, and writing that shows concrete experience of how phenomenology has changed while still remaining what I found it to be then: a philosophic movement vital to the time in which I was living—now, the twenty-first century. I do not think of my experience as the paradigm but, rather, one of many exemplifications, and the one I understand best. It has been a trajectory of four distinct beginnings in phenomenology.</p>
         <p>Given the restrictions I must follow, however, I can only offer in outline form the first part that was originally a narrative, allowing the second part to offer substantive points, the lessons that the narrative was meant to lead to. Thus rather than the prepared paper, this will be more like the compact presentation I actually made at the fiftieth anniversary meeting.</p>

            <p>Here my “trajectory” account ends. The overall outcome: how several meanderings and renewed “beginnings” gave me familiarity with the diverse ways of rival philosophic endeavors (along divers intellectual undertakings such as anthropology, sociology, and history), enabling me to become better able to discern just what the decisive factors of Husserl's accomplishment were that enabled phenomenology to be still vital in philosophical thinking.</p>

            <title>Four Essential Features</title>
            <p>If I had to offer four pivotal characteristics of an investigation that stamped it as phenomenological, here is what I might propose. First, from Husserl's beginning in phenomenological investigation, the overall aim was<italic>to clarify the ground of origination</italic>for the elements constitutive of human experience. The question was not simply the fundament<italic>on which</italic>human experience rested but the origin<italic>from which</italic>it came to<italic>be</italic>in its constitutive character. Such was manifestly the overarching move in<italic>Logical Investigations</italic>, namely, from the vigorous defense of the ideality of the logical to the investigations in which the ground for ideality would be found.</p>
            <p>Second, what made this effort<italic>specifically phenomenology</italic>began to be laid out in<italic>Ideas I</italic>with Husserl's famous<italic>epochē</italic>—the suspending of such conceptual schemata as presuppositionally set the character of the region of one's search for “ground,” especially naturalistic conceptions of the way human being is lodged in the world of nature, in the physical universe of natural science.<xref rid="r001" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>1</sup>
               </xref>Setting all such out of play was indispensible for opening up the world around us specifically<italic>as one of phenomena</italic>, of<italic>appearing</italic>, the basic character of reality<italic>as we experience things</italic>in multi-sense-modal perception.<xref rid="r002" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>2</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>After these two points irremovably constitutive of phenomenology—and largely taken for granted by many philosophies that lodge under the broad tent of “Continental philosophy,” both<italic>then</italic>when SPEP was beginning and<italic>now</italic>when SPEP is beginning its fiftieth year—the next ones I would propose are those from which divergence begins and dispute can occur. It is the question of the<italic>kind</italic>of ground of origination that Husserl proposes to find in his epochē-prepared phenomenology.</p>
            <p>Third, with the phenomenological epochē in play, Husserl's next methodological move sets the essential<italic>direction</italic>of his quest for the ground of origination. Within this region of sense-qualitative meaningfulness that is the world transformed, the ground of origination had to be sought precisely there where sense-qualitative-meaning took shape, namely, in the living experience of sense-qualitatively given manifest things and events in the surrounding world. In the<italic>Ideas</italic>project, this means the<italic>phenomenological reduction</italic>, “returning”—perhaps better “following”—always already originated factors and structures of experience back to their having come about in always already working<italic>transcendental originative process</italic>.</p>
            <p>Here is where one of the important lessons of my trajectory account applies, namely, that the way one comes to identify an “absolute” of origins is itself<italic>relative</italic>, not<italic>absolute</italic>. On the one hand, different issue-oriented motivations and strategies of inquiry guide us to what we expect lies<italic>behind</italic>and<italic>generates</italic>the familiar features, factors, and forms of one's life experiences; and this of necessity leads us to conceive the something-behind-it-all<italic>in terms of</italic>those very issue-driven motivations, strategies, and efforts. How else could we raise the question with genuine philosophical incentive? At the same time, on the other hand, we have to make explicit the<italic>methodological principles</italic>for finding and characterizing those originative factors—and more than anything else the way motivations and strategies and efforts to reach those factors may have<italic>limits</italic>precisely in the attempt to bring<italic>ultimate origination itself</italic>to clarity, beyond simply entertaining<italic>ideas</italic>about it. Thus, precisely because phenomenology's investigations ultimately aim to disclose the sources of all meaning and structure in the world as such of one's being, experiencing, and movement, then, precisely because the world is the very<italic>framework</italic>of all finding, ascertaining, and articulating—and most especially in the fundamental pairing that sets the origina<italic>ted</italic>in relation to its origina<italic>tor</italic>—this culminating aim in phenomenology may prove to be in principle<italic>beyond investigational grasp</italic>.</p>
            <p>The paradigm of this conception of possible limits is Immanuel Kant, for German idealism; but the one who articulated the starkly analogous issue in Husserlian phenomenology is Eugen Fink. Kant's raising of the issue was instantly famous; Fink's formulation of it in his “Sixth Cartesian Meditation: The Idea of a Transcendental Theory of Method” was never published during Husserl's or his lifetime,<xref rid="r003" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>3</sup>
               </xref>and for that reason it was recognized as stating a fundamental problem by only a few thinkers in phenomenology other than Husserl himself and Fink.<xref rid="r004" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>4</sup>
               </xref>Heidegger had never seen it, nor does he appear to have himself discerned in his own thinking the issue Fink's essay lays out. Merleau-Ponty, in contrast, was quite appreciative of the issue. Finally, one has to mention Jan Patočka, a close friend of Fink's from his first visit to Freiburg in 1933 through to the end of his life.<xref rid="r005" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>5</sup>
               </xref>For Patočka the move to an “a-subjective phenomenology,” together with a point he makes about the inaccessibility of the “bottom” for “the human reach for meaning” in his essay “Does History Have a Meaning?” gives indication of Patočka's grasp of at least the principles of this same methodological issue.<xref rid="r006" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>6</sup>
               </xref>This situation, now, sets up the final fundamental feature for phenomenological investigation in the<italic>now</italic>of the present period.</p>
            <p>Thus, fourth, it is crucial to realize that, however dramatically and emphatically Husserl trumpeted “transcendental consciousness” and its “absolute subjectivity” in<italic>Ideas I</italic>, and despite the continued use of these very terms up to the very end of his life, twenty years later the thrust of his last manuscript probing of the Truly Ultimate in the constitution of meaningful appearing and conscious experience drastically modulated the character and status of what “consciousness” and “subjectivity” must mean. For missing in<italic>Ideas I</italic>, as Husserl unambiguously points out, was an actual analysis of the “ultimate true Absolute”<italic>in which</italic>the<italic>apparent</italic>“absolute”—the “absolute consciousness” that gets all the attention in<italic>Ideas I</italic>—“has its origin [<italic>Urquelle</italic>]” and hence<italic>is not</italic>“in truth the ultimate.” And the ultimate true “Absolute” will only come clear when the factor of temporalization is finally investigated<italic>as far as it is possible to go</italic>in this effort.<xref rid="r007" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>7</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>Here, now, is the principal overarching structural factor in the ultimate ground- or origin-seeking phenomenological inquiry on which the issue of adequacy in phenomenological reach weighs more heavily than on any other element or feature. For temporality (<italic>Zeitlichkeit</italic>) as the basic character of structuration—or, as genetic<italic>dynamic</italic>, temporalization (<italic>Zeitigung</italic>)—is the very process of constitutive<italic>sense-origination</italic>for every feature of experiential life, perceptual and pragmatic, in the world of manifest appearing. Hence until this absolute fundament is fully clarified, no other topic, element, structure, or process in phenomenology can receive its full determinative explication.</p>
            <p>Yet it is on the question of the in principle efficacy of the analysis of temporality/temporalization that Husserl's work<italic>remains unsettled</italic>. While others might differ on this, I would argue that the last set of efforts on Husserl's part to describe analytically temporality/temporalization exemplifies the radical, in principle<italic>nonaccessibility</italic>of an ultimate true “Absolute.”<xref rid="r008" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>8</sup>
               </xref>Moreover, it is this feature that seals the inescapability of what I early called the relativity of any positive conception of an<italic>absolute</italic>of grounding or origination.</p>
            <p>Yet this need not be a<italic>foundering</italic>or an ultimate<italic>meaninglessness</italic>; for an in principle<italic>always continuing</italic>openness to further disclosures in the fields of phenomenological investigation is precisely what characterized Husserl's own path of inquiry and that of everyone working thereafter within that same program of essentials. In other words, the essentials are not those of doctrinal holdings but, rather, of the<italic>methodological necessities</italic>that result from the all-comprehensive ultimacy of the problematic of phenomenology's aims: the aims, namely, to show how the<italic>phenomena</italic>of our experiential situation, together with the basic dimensions of those phenomena in the realm of their appearing—<italic>the world</italic>—and, as developing within that fundamental situation, how the<italic>thematizing</italic>of sense or meaning as such, especially in<italic>reflection</italic>, have all<italic>come about</italic>.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s01_5">
            <title>Corollary Considerations</title>
            <p>Finally, with these four features in hand, I wish to add a few notes on some of the realizations that thinkers in phenomenology have come to that confirm their status as advancing phenomenology further as a philosophic program. First, the differences between themes that Husserl spends a lot of time on and those his successors focus on do not amount to criteria for belonging to phenomenology<italic>the program</italic>. So, for example, the fact that Heidegger focused on questions of an individual's factic existence and the proper way of giving expression to it—his primary concern in his early sets of lectures from 1919 through to<italic>Being and Time</italic>, his “Husserlian” phase, some term it—and, with<italic>Being and Time</italic>, that same issue as offering a line of privileged accession to the “sense of being [<italic>Seinssinn</italic>]” are easily shown to comply with the characteristics I have laid out. That Heidegger shifts from an “I-consciousness” to “my existence” is no disqualification so far as I can see. Heidegger is working within an epochē and hence the realm of<italic>sense</italic>and its origination no less than is Husserl. Even his shift in style of thinking and analyzing after 1930, despite its seemingly unbounded free-imaginative succession of names for approaching or characterizing the “ultimacy” that lies in<italic>Sein</italic>—thus the meditations around<italic>Ereignis</italic>,<italic>Geheiß</italic>, and<italic>Gestell</italic>, to name just a few—is an aiming at a unique kind of ultimate (even if not at all a “ground”), the result of which is to exhibit perhaps more than anything else the relativity of any such designations. They all work a kind of disclosure—very differently from Husserl—but none of them works absolutely.</p>
            <p>Second, this way of characterizing Heidegger is similar to what I would offer, still with sharp differences, regarding Jacques Derrida. I find Derrida's project governed from beginning to end by the nonability of phenomenology (or of any other intellectual undertaking) to<italic>reach</italic>an ultimate of origin. Placing his 1953–54<italic>mémoire</italic>and two of his books, one large,<italic>De la grammatologie</italic>(1967; trans. Baltimore, 1974), and one small,<italic>Positions</italic>(1972; trans. Chicago, 1981), together with the fact that the transformation of the field of philosophic concern was worked entirely in the play of wordings, in the play of<italic>meaning differentiation and collusion</italic>, exhibits the four characteristics I have proposed. For Derrida regularly showed—after<italic>On Grammatology</italic>and<italic>Positions</italic>, usually without saying so—how the absolute nonfeasibility of finding origins would undermine any assertion of canonic status and stability for conceptualities. Instead, the very meaningfulness of canonic terminology (a) demanded a freer play of meaning for understanding any such purported paradigmatic sense, (b) showed the nonvalidity of any absolute priority-granting properness to their usage, and (c) exhibited instead their fundamental<italic>relativity</italic>. No other person in phenomenology came close to the effectiveness Derrida showed in this, and very few, so far as I know, recognize the phenomenology-necessitated character of these efforts.</p>
            <p>Third, on Jan Patočka's status here I think the primary point to mention is that his engagement in phenomenology developed from his beginning with a phenomenological focus on nature and world to his finding himself having to adapt it as a resource of sufficient power to aid in developing a viable response to the crushing politics of Soviet-style social authoritarianism. Indeed, the relativity of purported absolutes within the field of fundamental meaning—with I-centered subjectivity displaced in favor of an asubjectivity—and the living and the endlessly renewed effort to fashion meaningfulness enabled Patočka to develop and put into practice his social and political recasting of the intellectual tradition running from classical Greece to transcendental phenomenology that could renew Czechoslovakia's cultural substance against the rigidities of police-state Bolshevik dogmatism. In this, Patočka was a consummate<italic>engaged</italic>phenomenologist.</p>
            <p>Fourth, Merleau-Ponty's final project following upon his<italic>Phenomenology of Perception</italic>was an ambitious undertaking that shared many of the aims of the philosophical endeavors all too briefly reviewed; yet there are significant differences that both draw close to Husserl's working practice and displace it with another aim and schematic of conceptuality. Like Husserl, Merleau-Ponty had a penchant for visuality as a primary example of a sense-modal integrative schematicity, even as he followed Husserl's turn in<italic>Ideas II</italic>to begin valorizing the sense-modality of broader qualitative sense dimensions—and especially pathic corporeal awareness, principally kinesthesia, and proprioception—as all crucial in the constitution of sense for and in the world. Merleau-Ponty also took up the anonymity mode of protoconstitution that Husserl entertained in his manuscripts, despite Husserl's insisting upon a nonpersonal kind of “I-pole” in the now-structure of the living present.</p>
            <p>The most important modifications, however, that Merleau-Ponty tried to develop in his final lecturing and writing were to recast the character of “the transcendental of origins” by retooling phenomenology to become a radically<italic>nondichotomous</italic>descriptive analysis of<italic>la nature</italic>and<italic>l'esprit</italic>—nature and spirit/mind. Moreover, Merleau-Ponty was trying to fashion a nondichotomous investigative thrust for virtually all the tradition divisions in philosophy's conceptual toolbox, such as “existence” and “essence,” “sensation and intellection,” “necessity” and “contingency.” And this meant that in principle a<italic>flexibly dialectical integrative spectrum</italic>of lexical terms had to be developed to express the philosophic articulation he was trying to establish. Yet throughout it all Merleau-Ponty's guiding principle remained<italic>die Sachen selbst</italic>, precisely to the extent that careful phenomenological practice in epochē- and reduction-governance is in force. These remarks, however, are hardly adequate to characterize what Merleau-Ponty was doing in his last writings, but they shall have to do.</p>
            <p>And with this I must close my presentation, except to mention two things. The first is that what I think my treatment shows is that what dominates in phenomenology today is not the question “What<italic>is</italic>phenomenology?” but, rather, “What is (are) phenomenology's<italic>question(s)</italic>?” And the second thing to mention is that it is in the framework of the understanding that I have been laying out here that my<italic>fourth beginning</italic>—and probably my<italic>last</italic>—lies.</p>

         <title>Individuality of the “I”: Brentano and Today</title>
         <sec id="s02_1">
            <title>1. Introduction</title>
            <p>The Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), as a fifty-year-old movement of both phenomenologically and existentially disposed philosophers, may regard Franz Brentano (1838–1917) as at least a grandfather. For many SPEP members, including myself until very recently, Brentano has been known in a rather vague and inauthentic empty intention merely as the teacher of Husserl, foremost in regard to some aspects of the doctrine of intentionality. Upon closer inspection this is pitifully shortsighted, and I have come to believe that the phenomenologist's lineage to the grandfather is not to be forgotten and that retrieving it may bring out not only differences but surprising enrichments that will emerge through wrestling with the differences.<xref rid="r009" ref-type="fn">

         <sec id="s02_2">
            <title>2. The Emergence of the Theme of I as Substance</title>
            <p>My interest in this and many other allied topics was first awakened by Manfred Frank,<xref rid="r010" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>2</sup>
               </xref>who has noted that the teachings found in the first and only volume that Brentano published (in 1874) of his<italic>Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint</italic>developed a rather I-less theory of consciousness.<xref rid="r011" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>3</sup>
               </xref>It was not nonegological as an explicit denial of an I-moment or ingredient, but the position he developed might lead to that conclusion. Brentano's emphasis was on the mere ontological unity of consciousness in the present as revealed in the pre-reflective or inner perception that accompanies all intentional acts. In the flux there is that of which one is conscious in one's presencing, judging, and emotive-voluntary acts. But there is also the ineluctable self-knowing whereby these acts are also presenced. Is the one presencing also so presenced, that is, simply as another contemporary object along with the perceptually presenced, the judged, and the desired? No, the self is presenced only as a self-presencing of the intentional act, which, for example, perceives externally what is not the self who/which is presencing. Yet early on Brentano insists that the exterior presencing is always also a<italic>self</italic>-presencing.</p>
            <p>Inner perception is analogous to outer perception in that it, too, is founded on a presenting or presencing, a<italic>Vorstellen</italic>, but inner perception is subordinate, and its object is not primarily and explicitly targeted but, rather, secondary and implicit. When one hears the sound the presenced sound is primary and the presenced hearing secondary. But the concrete whole act of hearing the sound is always at once a case of one's presencing the sound and presencing, secondarily and implicitly, one's hearing of the sound. (Inner perception's presencing is always of what is actually present; Husserl's retention or retention of retentions is not part of what Brentano's inner perception presences.)</p>
            <p>For Brentano, the whole that is “the unity of consciousness” is the unity of that of which one is conscious in exterior and interior perception. That “of which one is conscious” includes the acts presenting that of which one is conscious—there is no being-conscious without a presencing quasi-reflective act. This effects an inner appearing of … to—, a genitive and dative of manifestation. The whole is not something simple but, rather, made up of parts (he called them early on “divisives”) that are not identical with one another or the whole. Thus, for example, acts of memory are neither identical with feelings nor identical with the whole, which is the unified whole of consciousness (or that of which one is conscious). Yet they belong to<italic>one</italic>real entity or “thing” (the unity of that of which one is conscious) and enjoy a common membership with all the other acts in this one real thing.<xref rid="r012" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>4</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>In later writings, some of which appeared as the second and third volumes of<italic>Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint</italic>, but especially<italic>The Theory of Categories</italic>, these parts are called the modes or accidents, which are distinct from one another but are said to belong to the substance, a subsisting entity, as the common part presenced presently in the inner perception of whatever acts. Eventually the “I” is named this substance. In a rich section of the<italic>Kategorienlehre</italic>, Brentano argues that inner perception provides strong evidence that “one and the same mental substance must underlie all the psychical activities that fall within our inner perception. And this substance, to the extent it has an awareness of itself we call our self or our I.”<xref rid="r013" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>5</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>Brentano famously retrieved and reworked the Aristotelian theory of substance and accident: “That person errs considerably who believes that [the concept of substance] is not to be found included in any particular perception, because it rather in fact is given in every perception.”<xref rid="r014" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>6</sup>
               </xref>Moreover, he believed that the first-personal experience of the unity of consciousness was the exemplary display of the ontological dimension of substance. The agnostic and skeptical looking within for some elusive identifiable self-thing or looking without for the “I know not what” underlying appearings must give way to the ineluctable first-personal looking, questioning, doubting, and so on, that is, the ongoing unifying and underlying presencing agency of the one inquiring. One must not overlook that inner perception is only analogous to external perception. It is not a matter of armchair philosophizing or a matter of introspection and observation. Rather, it is the ineluctable self-presence of the intentional life to itself.</p>
            <p>Yet we saw in the passage quoted above a qualification (“to the extent”) to establishing equivalence between the mental substance and “I.” The chief reason is Brentano's critique of Descartes's view that the mind (<italic>qua res cogitans</italic>) is always thinking. But for Brentano deep dreamless sleep means that the self/I becomes absent, and so we must not simply equate the psychic substance (traditionally called “soul”) with the self-aware I or the subject. In this respect, Brentano would not follow Bolzano, for whom it would be inappropriate to say, “I have a soul,” because for Bolzano “soul” means the first-person referent of “I,” which<italic>has</italic>its acts, body, brain, and so on.<xref rid="r015" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>7</sup>
               </xref>Yet Brentano's claim that there is self-awareness by the I-substance rounds out his own view of self-awareness as a “knowing [<italic>Bekenntnis</italic>] which relates itself to that which has the knowing.” And such a<italic>Kenntnis</italic>“is an accident and each which has the knowledge is a substance.”<xref rid="r016" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>8</sup>
               </xref>Yet there is no necessary connection between the substance of “I” or “self” and the accident of self-awareness. We will return to this.</p>
            <p>One may be tempted to hold that Brentano's view of a psychic substance moves toward a dual-aspect theory (such as Peter Strawson's position), where the object present in the third person (“person” [for Strawson] or “brain” [for others]) is the substrate of both the ascribed mental and physical properties. Yet Brentano believed that it “was beyond any doubt” that mental phenomena have something mental as their substantial support and not something extended.<xref rid="r017" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>9</sup>
               </xref>But when the mental substance is not awake it does not fall out of existence but, rather, continues to exist and somehow as the unconscious mental substance is itself the possibility and the source of subsequent consciousness.<xref rid="r018" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>10</sup>
               </xref>The question perhaps remains whether this unconsciousness is itself utter oblivion or a consciousness of the possibility to be self-reflexive, which reflexivity is always the heart of consciousness for Brentano.</p>
            <p>Whereas exterior perception for Brentano is always a matter of uncertainty and inference, inner perception provides the highest form of evidence. This is so, claims Brentano, because it has to do with what is identical with itself. Fallible knowledge of external perception presupposes nonidentity of knower and known, but the self-presencing achieved by inner perception is a matter of one's being consciously identical with oneself. This is an extremely rich yet problematic position in Brentano's writings. Here he makes the distinction between knowledge of oneself<italic>per accidens</italic>and knowledge of oneself<italic>per se</italic>. This is a distinction now fairly commonly made among analytic philosophers. For example, H.-N. Castañeda spoke of an externally reflexive self-knowing and a proper internally reflexive self-knowing.<xref rid="r019" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>11</sup>
               </xref>In the former case, I can know myself as someone else and/or perhaps as everyone else does. A famous example of such<italic>per accidens self-knowledge</italic>is Ernst Mach's perceiving that shabby old pedagogue struggling down the aisle of the streetcar, not knowing that whom he saw was himself—until perhaps someone else points it out or he himself has the realization. In the case of this latter knowing or realization there is a<italic>knowing myself as myself</italic>; this is a<italic>per se</italic>, not<italic>per accidens</italic>, self-knowing for Brentano. And it is this that inner perception achieves automatically, infallibly, and ineluctably.<xref rid="r020" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>12</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>I say that this is a problematic area in Brentano's theory because inner awareness is generally described as a kind of quasi-reflective intentional act, a Vorstellen, and it is not clear how such an act is to achieve the identity of self-awareness. The issue's complexity has led an outstanding Brentano commentator to forget that inner awareness for Brentano is itself the exemplary form of an identity between knower and known. Fugali notes that Brentano would seem to find the common pleonastic expressions such as “my I” (= “an I of the I that is mine”) to involve a hopeless infinite regress. And the infinite regress is avoided, Fugali believes, because the object of self-consciousness is the lived possibility (cf. Husserl's “I can”) of being an I (through reflection).<xref rid="r021" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>13</sup>
               </xref>And behind this argument is the more basic consideration for Fugali that because there is no identity between oneself and one's self-awareness, “there is always a distinction between self-awareness and that observing awareness which regards itself as an object.”<xref rid="r022" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>14</sup>
               </xref>In such a view inner perception as modeled on exterior perception triumphs and inner perception cannot be a<italic>per se</italic>self-knowing.</p>
            <p>However, as J.-P. Sartre, Michel Henry, Sydney Shoemaker, Dieter Henrich, Manfred Frank, Dan Zahavi et al. (including more or less implicitly, Husserl also) have shown, unless one is pre- and nonreflectively self-present, that is, always already familiar with oneself prior to reflection, it is not clear that a reflective act could ever achieve a noncriterial, immediate, direct self-presence that cashes out as the identity so important for Brentano. Indeed, if this prior self-acquaintance or self-awareness that is prior to all forms of reflection and identifying knowing, is not there from the start, then serious problems of an infinite regress arise if all self-knowing is thought of as requiring criterial identifying features; in other words, there are problems of establishing these criterial features by which one is identified as oneself, how they indeed are tied to oneself, are me, mine, and so on and not someone, or proper to someone, else. Fugali's Brentano would seem to fall into this error because he does not separate the essentially inadequate self-reflection of the personal I from the essential nonreflective self-presence of the I. This latter is denied on the basis that for Brentano an I cannot exist without its acts, for example, it may be unconscious, asleep, or in a coma. And self-awareness properly is an act analogous to perception, and at least it is an awareness of the possibility of enjoying itself as an object in reflection.</p>

         <sec id="s02_3">
            <title>3. A Sketch of Brentano's Position on the Individuality of the “I”</title>
            <p>This problem of how inner perception achieves<italic>per se knowing</italic>comes out acutely in Brentano's discussion of the knowledge of one's individual identity. On the one hand, in his discussions it seems obvious to him that one has a knowledge of oneself and one's individuality. Yet there are two main obstacles to saying that we know ourselves as individuals. The first is that for Brentano the basement of all knowing, Vorstellen, presencing in its incipiency is a presenting of what is general. Further, all enriched knowing moves from the general to the particular, from the generic to the specific. Thus inner perception as a form of Vorstellen is a presencing of oneself to oneself in a most general,<italic>not</italic>a unique, way. The second obstacle is that individuation is a matter of definite descriptions, “eidetic singularities,” as Husserl would say, or of<italic>infima species</italic>, that is, the determination of the ultimate, lowest distinguishing property. Individuation is having the distinguishing property that individuates, and knowing this is a matter of bringing to light how the individual becomes an individual through displaying the individuating property.</p>
            <p>The inner perception of ourselves as a matter basically of Vorstellen is most general, but we only know ourselves by contrasting ourselves with other individuated individuals. Yet we only know others, that is, other selves, believes Brentano, by inference from their bodily presence to<italic>their</italic>self-awareness and self-knowledge. Thus as the individual differences of others are excluded from us, so they are excluded from the others' self-knowing. As a result our knowledge of our individuality is something that we cannot possibly know simply by our acquaintance with ourselves; but it cannot be known merely by our acquaintance with others present through their bodies, because the others are presumably in the same situation of ignorance in regard to themselves.</p>
            <p>Brentano concedes that we do not grasp the substance of our self merely in general as anything whatsoever but specified as a mental substance and adds that “we do not grasp this substance as individuated by ultimate substantial differences.”<xref rid="r023" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>15</sup>
               </xref>However, in an effort to account for how it is that each I is de facto aware of himself as being a determinate individual and as the one individual substance underlying all psychical or mental activities—and we are aware innerly of this with the absolute certitude of inner perception—Brentano has recourse to a kind of transcendental argument: Something can have such immediate evidence not through perceiving another thing but only because it is identical with itself—“now a thing can have immediate evidence only of that which<italic>is identical</italic>with it.”<xref rid="r024" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>16</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>On the one hand, here and elsewhere Brentano appears to prefer a sense of the awareness of the I's individuation as a third-person reflective knowing of infima species or a definite description that of necessity involves relating to and contrasting with others—but this is not possibly delivered in one's first-personal inner perception of oneself. On the other hand, he believes at the same time that inner perception accounts for the intuitive prima facie conviction of our unique individuality and further holds not only that inner perception is a result of our having immediate evidence of our identity with ourselves but also that this is a knowledge or acquaintance that is<italic>per se</italic>and not<italic>per accidens</italic>; in other words, it is a knowledge pertaining to oneself as oneself.<xref rid="r025" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>17</sup>
               </xref>Here perhaps we have an incipient theory of the distinctive self-awareness of persons as spirits based on his theory of self-awareness as<italic>per se</italic>knowing, which, as I noted, has, as inner perception, flawed formulations that undermine the project.</p>
            <p>This theory of the legitimacy of the intuition or prima facie sense of our own unique individuality is supported by Brentano's ontological position on the I as substance and substance itself as the principle of individuation. In this matter of the individuation of the I-substance there is thus a serious tension. On the one hand, the preferred consideration for Brentano is that something is individuated properly through its ultimate distinguishing determination or feature, the infima species. On the other hand, Brentano is convinced that what distinguishes all our acts ultimately is that they are acts of this substance, this I. Here the third-personal thing-ontology and first-personal phenomenological ontology seem inextricably bound up with one another.</p>
            <p>Here are some texts of interest: “For that which inheres is individuated by that which subsists, and if the latter were not individuated in any of its parts, then there would be no individuation.”<xref rid="r026" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>18</sup>
               </xref>In another text we find that substance, as the most individuating part of the whole that is the concrete person, “individuates, and is implicitly given in every human act of consciousness.”<xref rid="r027" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>19</sup>
               </xref>And again in<italic>The Theory of Categories</italic>: “Substance is individuated by itself, where the accidents are individuated not by themselves alone, but in relation to the individuality of the substance.”<xref rid="r028" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>20</sup>
               </xref>Again: “And when we speak of our self, we intend not merely the concept of a substance in general, but also a particular individual falling under this concept, and we say that this individual at one and the same time senses, thinks, loves and hopes, hates and fears.”<xref rid="r029" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>21</sup>
               </xref>And in explicating Aristotle Brentano seems to declare his own position and states that if the substantial principle of a thing were “to fall away or be varied in any respect, then the substance would be another individual.”<xref rid="r030" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>22</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>In what follows I will indicate other not explicitly Brentanian directions in which we may be urged to adopt the I-substance as the principle of individuation.</p>

            <title>4. Individuation<italic>Per Se</italic>and Individuation<italic>Per Accidens</italic>
            </title>
            <p>Given Brentano's assertion that the substance is a principle of individuation, we may say that he moves toward holding not merely for a theory of<italic>per se knowing</italic>but also for a theory of<italic>per se individuation</italic>. Indeed, the I-substance is the exemplary case of<italic>per se</italic>individuation. We may say that<italic>per se</italic>individuation occurs when there is some respect in which I know my self or you to be unique and it is I myself or it is you yourself who individuates the properties one has. Another alternative and more familiar version of this would be: I know you to be unique through some property, which I know you to have uniquely. But neither this being uniquely you nor I being uniquely me, nor in the more familiar position of one's being unique by having this unique property, is a case of one's being unique by being related to some other individual. The individuation by relation to others is<italic>per accidens individuation</italic>, where individuals are achieved ontologically and phenomenologically or presentationally by a<italic>process of individuating</italic>, that is, one's being related to someone/something else.<italic>Per se</italic>individuation in one's own case happens through one's being consciously identical with oneself and<italic>not</italic>by my being myself by relating me to or being related with some other individual thing. In the case of someone else, foremost in the second person, it is through recognizing the other in herself but not through identifying her by relating her to someone or something else. (Doubtless this latter identification of relating others to others would seem to be a condition for, but not identical with, uncovering the former<italic>per se</italic>sense of individuality; see below.) The feature or property of<italic>being me</italic>or of<italic>being identical with myself</italic>in a self-aware way is the basis of my being sui generis or an “individual essence” or haecceity. It is not merely the empty logical claim of the identity of indiscernibles or the ontological claim for an haecceity; rather, one is sui generis because being oneself self-awarely is the condition of saying “I” and this is what this indexical brings to light.<xref rid="r031" ref-type="fn">

            <p>
               <italic>Pace</italic>both Brentano and Chisholm, if the I is substance and the principle of individuation, we must steer clear of saying that the unique essence is what one has and, rather, hold that the unique essence is precisely what “I” refers to and it does not refer to a property of this referent. In this case the I-substance is self-individuating, that is,<italic>per se</italic>and not individuated<italic>per accidens</italic>or by reason of being put in relation with another. Of course, we must keep separate the phenomenological-ontological distinctions that surface among “the ‘I’” (or “my I”) as material for eidetic analysis, what the indexical “I” brings to light, and what this indexical “I” pre-reflectively presupposes for its reference. In the latter two cases we do not need individuating markers; nor do we have to do with what/who has properties but, rather, with what/who is nonsortal and referred to nonascriptively. (See below.)</p>
            <p>Of course, it is obvious that we come to know “persons” (or “personal I's”) by a process of comparison, that is, we understand persons not merely as what “I” refers to but as what I's have, what Husserl would call their “habitualities.” That is, we refer to them as beings in the world with others. In this respect knowing persons is indeed a matter of an identification of someone by<italic>per accidens individuation</italic>. The distinguishing properties that single me out for myself and for you in terms of bodily shape, species or kind, face, psychical and moral traits, gender, profession, autobiography, ethnicity, nationality, locality, place in time, and so on and so forth are a matter of individuation<italic>per accidens</italic>or of relating me or the other person to what is other than me or other than she or he. Yet, if we may consider the hypothesis that there is a sense in which what “I” refers to is not a mere bundle or constellation of properties (which in principle is repeatable), we may entertain a sense in which what/whom “I” refers to is nonsortal—nonpropertied—and this may give us reason to pause in thinking of<italic>person</italic>simply as a sortal term.</p>
            <p>Brentano himself perhaps takes a tiny step in this direction when he says of the I-substance (as the individuating independent part of consciousness) that it does not have length, breadth, or depth; nor is it round or square, nor does it have color and other sensory qualities.<xref rid="r032" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>24</sup>
               </xref>And further, given that it is without any such bodily differentiation, he says that there is a consideration that serves as a positive substitute: in inner perception the I-substance appears to us “not merely as substance but also in contrast to that which is corporeal, as a spiritual [<italic>geistige</italic>] substance.” In other words it is presented “as a zero-dimensional substance which, although it is unextended, is a thing for itself without any connectedness to its surroundings. It thus does not appear as a mere boundary like a point in a continuum of points.”<xref rid="r033" ref-type="fn">

            <title>5. Evoking the I-Referent as Nonsortal and I-Reference as Nonascriptive</title>
            <p>Consider how when I use proper names, such as “Franz Brentano,” my reference targets directly the person who has the properties and not any of the properties of the person. This contrasts with when I say “the great Austrian philosopher who was Husserl's teacher,” where Franz Brentano is targeted mediately through his properties.<xref rid="r034" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>26</sup>
               </xref>Consider also that when I say “you” I invoke what you refer to when you say “I” and not any properties you have. And when I love someone this love intends, affirms, and celebrates what he refers to when he says “I.” And this form of intentionality is quite different from when I admire, esteem, or lust after someone, where her properties are very much part of the focus of my attention. When these properties vanish or prove to be bogus, I can no longer admire or revere the person; but it is quite intelligible to love someone even when he or she is no longer admirable or beautiful.<xref rid="r035" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>27</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>If it is true that love and the invocation of the second-personal pronoun target what the other person refers to with “I,” then we may consider that this is likewise not a property or a quality. Indeed this is necessarily so because what “I” refers to is “myself as myself,” and in so doing I achieve the<italic>per se</italic>knowing to which Brentano called attention. But quite in opposition to another strain in his thought, I propose that I need no third-personal, nonindexical, descriptive terms or properties to achieve this knowing. Prior to the achievement of “I” as a reflective intentional act, but also in the reflective indexical achievement of “I,” I am aware uniquely of myself, and I don't have to be aware of anything else but myself to achieve this.<xref rid="r036" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>28</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus “I” is essentially a nonascriptive form of (self-)reference. And its target is precisely what is itself nonsortal, nonpropertied. (Husserl's descriptions of the “pure I” and I-pole find symmetry here.)<xref rid="r037" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>29</sup>
               </xref>I suggest that the referent of “I” is the haecceity or unique essence of “myself” that is individuated<italic>per se</italic>. I propose that the evidence for this is what founds Robert Spaemann's thesis that<italic>person</italic>is a nonsortal term. Some considerations may help evoke the basis for this claim. Again, of course, persons as identifiable beings in the world with others are of necessity laced with properties. Think of our public personae; our status before our municipal, county, or state governments; and our identity for the federal government as well as our colleagues and acquaintances.</p>
            <p>But consider the referents when I say, “Come here, I want to show you a gorilla,” “Come here, I want to show you a human being,” “Here look at this beautiful woman,” “Look at this hunk of a man,” and so forth, all of which feature properties. Now consider a quite different display: “Come here, I want to show you a person.” What are we here looking for? How does it differ from an individual human being? Granted that we in fact use<italic>person</italic>as synonymous with<italic>human being</italic>, are we here merely displaying an individual human being or instance of the kind called “human”? Consider the resistance in saying, “Come here, I want to show you a Barak Obama.” We might, of course, have in mind a political style or character and thus refer to a constellation of properties. But we would not be referring to the person, Barak Obama, certainly not to what he refers to when he says “I,” but, for example, to a type, a certain sort of politician.<xref rid="r038" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>30</sup>
               </xref>
            </p>
            <p>Another way of evoking the sense in which the person as fundamentally, if not adequately, what “I” refers to as a nonsortal reference is to consider the famous examples of teletransportation, as developed first by Derek Parfit but then marvelously elaborated on by Erich Klawonn, where through a glitch one finds oneself facing absolutely identical twins.<xref rid="r039" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>31</sup>
               </xref>Initially it is a matter of facing the impossibility of distinguishing the ontological twins. Thus one might be convinced that the Leibnizian claim is false—that if we appear to be confronted with two cases of absolutely identical properties, then either we fail to single out the ultimate distinguishing property (where interchangeable places are not regarded as inherent distinguishing properties) or there is but one being there (a position to which Brentano was inclined). In short, one might well disagree that if there are two beings, there must be given distinguishing properties. But it is quite another thing to face, in the first person, one's, for example, James G. Hart's, ontological clone and have the indubitable blazing insight: “Whoever you are, and by whatever equal right you might have to call yourself James G. Hart, I am not you—and I apperceive you to be convinced that you are not me.” Here who one is, is not determined by properties or sortal determinations, which, by way of generously granting the hypothesis of the thought experiment, are identically the same, that is, have the same properties, in the two cases.</p>

            <title>6. The Question of Memory's Importance for All Senses of Personal Identity</title>
            <p>Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.<xref rid="r040" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>32</sup>
               </xref>It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.<xref rid="r041" ref-type="fn">
                  <sup>33</sup>
               </xref>What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.</p>
            <p>Consider how you may be facing an operation and you have to make some decisions in regard to the procedures. In one case there is an expensive procedure requiring total anesthesia where no pain will be felt. The other is very inexpensive and requires no anesthesia. Thus, it will involve excruciating pain. But prior to the operation you can receive a drug that obliterates your memory of your present life. After the operation you will receive another drug that will extinguish your memory of the operation. Given the advantages of little expense and the avoidance of the pain that you, for example, John Brough, would feel, I ask you: Would it not be reasonable for you to opt for the less expensive operation? Or, rather, would it not be more reasonable to say that even though the one you now regard as John Brough would not be known by you, you now have no doubt that it is you who will be undergoing the excruciating pain at the time, and in this respect it will be a completely indifferent matter to you whether you can remember who you were the day before?<xref rid="r042" ref-type="fn">

            <p>The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.</p>

Fugali reports on an unpublished manuscript where Brentano criticizes any substantive-nominal uses of the first-personal pronoun that suggest an independent thing. What properly is independent is the achieved act along with its substantial<italic>Träger</italic>, i.e., the I. Further, this first-person pronoun does not indicate ultimate constitutive individuality but merely universal determinations that many individuals can have in common, such as the role of speaker. “I” may be substituted for legitimately with other personal pronouns or “the one speaking.” See Edoardo Fugali,<italic>Die Zeit des Selbst und die Zeit des Seienden</italic>(Würzburg: Koenigshausen und Neumann, 2004), 118ff. Yet Fugali also notes that, ontologically speaking, the soul or I as the substance is not changed in its ultimate unique individuality with the changes in accidents (experiences etc.) but only specifically by way of properties (120), even though Brentano is agnostic about our knowing these differences. See below. The conclusion below and my discussions more elaborately in my<italic>Who One Is</italic>, bk. 1 (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009) stand in contrast to several claims made here by Fugali's Brentano.</mixed-citation>

                  <mixed-citation>Besides the descriptions of the “pure I” and “I-pole” (see, e.g., ibid., 156ff.), there is the eidetic variation or thought experiment of world annihilation/disengagement and the transition from the propertied personal being in the world to the nonsortal pure subjectivity or pure I. I can “perform an eidetic” of pure subjectivity that moves from the corporeal being in the world to the pure “I am,” which holds even without the world and my bodiliness. See Edmund Husserl,<italic>Zur Lehre vom Wesen and zur Methode der eidetischen Variation: Text aus dem Nachlass (1891–1935)</italic>, ed.

                  <mixed-citation>Edith Stein wrestles excellently with the thesis that the individuality of persons is not reducible to being an instance of a species or an individual human being. Indeed she works toward a form of<italic>per se individuation</italic>.

                  <mixed-citation>It is noteworthy that Roderick Chisholm later observed: “If<italic>being identical with</italic>me is my individual essence and<italic>being identical with</italic>you is yours, then, presumably, each analyses into personhood and something else as well—one something else in my case and another in yours—but I haven't the faintest idea what this something else might be” (<italic>The First Person</italic>[Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1981], 16). See Hart,<italic>Who One Is</italic>, bk. 1, 276. The fuller conclusion to this essay is basically Husserl's own ontological position on the I's status as a radical substantial singularity; see ibid., 278ff.</mixed-citation>
